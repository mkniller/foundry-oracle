TwistedTri: right so a quick little recap then of where we were so you all got a chance to speak with uh the the pharaoh of al-kesh's uh like trusted advisors uh and they gave you a map of the region with uh after the the cartographer and the archaeologists were able to decipher the runes from the vision uh they gave you three main locations on the map for you to visit uh and you all as a group decided to uh try and get to the ruins that were to the northwest of al-kesh you guys uh actually we can switch over i will switch over to that so...

TwistedTri: you guys did manage to, uh, travel a little bit. uh, you got a few hexes away and then you had to take a break where you met some traveling gypsies who allowed you to camp with them. uh, the first thing that i would like to resolve is: everybody, make sure that you give yourself an additional luck token. so we are playing, remember, by pulp rules, which means that you can hold multiple luck tokens. you can hold as many as you can. there's no limit. uh, you will get one new one every session that we play. so just make sure that you, uh, give yourself that luck token if you have not done so already. uh,

zolloz89: I...

TwistedTri: the other thing that i would like to remind you all of is: yes,

Eric: Is that the, next to, is that next to the AC?

Eric: That left column?

TwistedTri: yep,

Eric: Okay.

TwistedTri: yep.

Eric: I had none, so I will give it.

TwistedTri: so instead of having a check box there now, now it should be a number box and you can earn them, and they are. so just a kind of a a re-overview of the of the house rules. you can share luck tokens amongst yourselves. so if, uh, someone doesn't have one, and it would be really beneficial, you're welcome to give a luck token to them. you can spend luck to re-roll. you can spend luck to make me roll with disadvantage, but you have to call it before i roll. you can spend a luck token to make a success, a critical success. but you have to tell me you're doing that before a damage roll is rolled. and let's see, i think those are the big ones for right now. uh, there was the one on spells. uh, but we we can address that one if that happens to come up at all.

TwistedTri: and then the, what was that?

zolloz89: don't know no spells.

zolloz89: I don't know no spells.

TwistedTri: yeah, let's see any other questions about house rules before we go any further. okay,

zolloz89: I don't think so.

TwistedTri: uh, so the next thing we need to resolve is: you all took a rest for the night. uh, so please make sure that you all take a ration from your inventory. so, unlike pathfinder, we are going to be dealing with rations in this game. so please make sure that you do take one of your rations. uh, because, or did we do that last time?

zolloz89: We did not do it.

nicole: we did not...

TwistedTri: okay,

Eric: Um,

TwistedTri: so make sure that you take a. make sure that you take one of your rations, uh, and use that for the evening that...

Eric: my, hold on.

Eric: My, my character button doesn't bring up my character. It's bringing up,

Eric: when I hit C, it's bringing up Shadow Dark.

Eric: So I don't have any items or treasure. I...

zolloz89: That's weird.

TwistedTri: is weird, because you're you have the right user configuration set up to bring up the role.

zolloz89: Maybe reload.

TwistedTri: yeah, why don't you do a? do a quick reload? i don't even know.

Eric: mean, I can click Durl and get to him through the party.

TwistedTri: yes, that's one way. i i wonder if are you on a new client than you were last time?

TwistedTri: so that's a different client. so some of your client settings are probably different. now i don't know if that's a client setting where you can set the the c key.

zolloz89: Maybe.

Eric: I'm, I'm definitely in a different PC. So I'm definitely,

TwistedTri: i thought that was standard profoundry for every client, but..

Eric: let me re,

Eric: I'm just going to reboot Foundry and see what happens. If not, I don't mind going to the menu and just clicking Durl. Because all I,

zolloz89: Sounds like it's done.

Eric: all I can see is party in Durl, and I think it's just defaulting to party for some reason.

TwistedTri: we'll uh we'll let you reload here uh so you were continuing on your uh your your trip to hit this desert ruin way up here to the northwest and so did everyone take their rations uh except for eric obviously all...

nicole: i'm sorry yeah...

Eric: Go to my inventory. So I just subtract one ration, right?

zolloz89: Yep.

Eric: Negative five, three plus. So I got to do,

zolloz89: Just hit that negative button, and it'll go down one.

Eric: oh, there we go. So, okay, I see. Oh, because you could have more than one slots worth. Okay, cool.

zolloz89: Yep.

Eric: Got it.

TwistedTri: right then if everybody is ready to roll uh we will say that it is uh it is morning so let's get to morning here i'm sorry not midday sunrise there we go all right it is 8 a.m and why don't you all tell me which way you want to go here so i think you guys can drag the only pick one of you amongst yourself uh pick who wants to drive the the party banner...

zolloz89: I did it last time.

Eric: All I can see is Nikki on the map.

zolloz89: What do you mean?

Eric: I just see Nikki and Jason. I don't see myself.

Eric: That's a problem.

zolloz89: Oh,

zolloz89: it's this. This is our moving. The little banner.

zolloz89: Not like our character icons.

Eric: Oh, I see. But you guys, okay.

Eric: Um, well, what we were talking the last time. Um, we, we were saying, I think, the dangerous place to go,

zolloz89: This is the bad labyrinth, and this is the ruin.

Eric: yeah, none of these are, are these supposed to have titles on them?

TwistedTri: nope...

Eric: Okay. All right. Scratch that then. Uh, and then there was the caves, right?

zolloz89: Yeah.

Eric: I feel like we were talking about maybe going, trying to go to the ruins.

Eric: And I can't remember what the logic was,

TwistedTri: yes...

zolloz89: Yep.

Eric: but yeah,

zolloz89: Because the other ones sound hard.

TwistedTri: so,

Eric: that sounds good.

TwistedTri: jason,

TwistedTri: why don't you? why don't you take control of the banner and tell me where you want to go?

zolloz89: I think we're going to go north one into, like, this valley in between the two mountain ranges.

TwistedTri: we'll go ahead and go ahead and do the drag because we. so that'll be four hours of travel. all right. so that opens up a little area and to the northwest you can see the opening of what looks to be some sort of maybe outpost. you can't really tell, unless until you get a little bit closer, so...

nicole: well then should we go closer...

zolloz89: Sounds like we're going closer, boys,

zolloz89: with a Z.

Eric: Yeah.

Eric: Let's go in.

TwistedTri: there is absolutely this um small little uh it looks abandoned uh outpost uh but it would definitely be a place that could offer you shelter as night is approaching uh if you would like to enter i...

Eric: Nothing there. No.

zolloz89: Sounds like bait, but let's do it.

Eric: Yep. Why not?

TwistedTri: don't know what you're talking about you're you're fine all right so right...

Eric: And there was nothing and you all live.

nicole: nothing to worry about wait...

Eric: There was nothing and you all live. No.

TwistedTri: so as you all, uh, enter, uh, rack,

TwistedTri: you probably can't see much because you're kind of off to the side there.

zolloz89: I'm,

TwistedTri: so there you go, all right. so ball, uh, you're kind of up first. so let's go ahead and put us put ourselves into. no,

zolloz89: like, not in the hallway. There we go.

nicole: we're in combat already oh...

zolloz89: We always have to be that way.

TwistedTri: but it has to be that way. when you go through these types of buildings or these rooms, so encounter in this one just keeps the turn base going so that you,

TwistedTri: you kind of keep it quick and everybody gets a chance to do something. so, uh, everybody, go ahead and roll your perception check there, or your initiative it's...

nicole: that's right it's...

zolloz89: Hell yeah, baby.

Eric: Hold on. I can't.

zolloz89: Get that one out the way.

Eric: I don't. So I don't see the initiative roll button.

nicole: not is it in chat...

Eric: Like I don't see in the encounter tracker. Yeah.

TwistedTri: it's in the encounter tracker,

TwistedTri: so you have to i.

Eric: Yeah.

Eric: I'm in there. I don't,

TwistedTri: i pause it where you have to i.

Eric: I don't,

TwistedTri: i hit the button and i think it rolled for everybody there. so um, if we'd like, we can reset those, so you get a chance to do that.

TwistedTri: so clear i...

Eric: it,

nicole: i'm good with my role i'm keeping my role the way it is...

Eric: it didn't matter. You, it doesn't matter to me. We can,

Eric: I, did you wait a second though? Did you, cause I'm not seeing a roll button next girl.

zolloz89: Yeah, we didn't do anything.

Eric: I think it has something to do with the way I think.

TwistedTri: i rolled for you all. on accident,

Eric: Got it. I got it.

TwistedTri: i hit a button and it rolled for you.

TwistedTri: all right,

Eric: All right.

nicole: matt ruined everything was...

TwistedTri: so i did.

Eric: That you ruined it.

TwistedTri: i'm sorry.

Eric: No,

TwistedTri: uh,

Eric: I...

TwistedTri: so we're going to go and you were first.

nicole: first before y'all all suck...

TwistedTri: but all right, dural, you, uh, you have the highest initiative here, so you are first there...

Eric: would like the game is paused by the way.

TwistedTri: you go i...

Eric: I would like. I would like to, I guess, light a candle.

Eric: I'm going to. Oh, wait. Now C is working.

Eric: Wait. To light a candle. I just have to right click on my character, right? Oh,

zolloz89: We can, yeah.

TwistedTri: know you have to do it from your character sheet...

zolloz89: Yeah.

Eric: I see. Right.

Eric: And that brought no light to anything.

zolloz89: We might be in a hallway where it doesn't really matter.

zolloz89: There's a door in front of you.

Eric: I'm going to move.

Eric: I just don't know which way to move. Is the door to my left or my right?

TwistedTri: well there's a door there's a door that needs to be there's a door that needs to be opened there...

Eric: I am going to say no guts, no glory. I'm going to open the door.

Eric: Now is that my actions? Lighten the torch and opening the door.

TwistedTri: opening the door is a free action that doesn't cost you anything all right so you enter and you see that this is a collapsed entry hall where moon moonlight seems to kind of spear in through cracks in the ceiling onto broken flagstones on the floor you can see on the ground with the torch light uh what looks like maybe itty bitty footprints you can't really they're not like human footprints but you can definitely see that there's some sort of some sort of footprints in the sand...

Eric: I'm going to walk in. I'm going to tiptoe in.

zolloz89: This guy really threw you at the giant centipede dungeon again, huh?

Eric: With that, I think that's going to be it for my turn. I need to find the end turn button,

Eric: which doesn't appear.

Eric: I feel like the encounter tracker is low end turn. Okay.

TwistedTri: it's the, it's the, all right. so do you have the encounter tracker popped out?

TwistedTri: okay,

Eric: Never mind. I see it.

TwistedTri: all right,

Eric: There we go.

TwistedTri: all right, grac.

Eric: It's changed slightly.

TwistedTri: i'm sorry, grok. all right, grok. as you step forward,

TwistedTri: you feel a little pressure under your foot and as you do, uh, this little, uh, scorpion pops up from under the foot plate and uh, starts kind of coming at you and it will join the initiative here. maybe there we go...

zolloz89: Oh, good.

zolloz89: Solid,

Eric: I'm not a friendly.

zolloz89: maybe. A scorpion. Whoa. It's rolling everything again?

TwistedTri: why does it rule everything? that's bizarre, but okay, whatever, all right,

zolloz89: It's like it's having,

TwistedTri: so the scorp that...

zolloz89: it's like it's doing a different, like, initiative. Because of the message in chat.

zolloz89: That auto-generate.

TwistedTri: should not be a setting but let me uh check that real quick you guys can talk amongst yourselves while i check that that...

TwistedTri: is a good question. i don't know where that is in here. that's got to be one of the core settings, i think.

TwistedTri: combat tracker well...

zolloz89: Yeah, probably.

zolloz89: Might be a shadow dark system setting. I think about it.

TwistedTri: i'm also using a new uh system down here i wonder if there's a option on this i'm...

TwistedTri: not seeing any options on that. so all right, we'll. uh, we'll let it go for now. i did myself at the bottom, all right. so the, uh, the scorpion is, uh, next in line. so you've got one action left there, grac, grac.

zolloz89: I'm going to hit a scorpion with my giant axe.

TwistedTri: okay, squish him that...

zolloz89: Target. Got my axe two-handed-like.

TwistedTri: is going to be a hit for six points of damage. uh, and you just, you just cleave this scorpion right in half, and uh,

TwistedTri: he is no more easy peasy, yep, that'll...

zolloz89: Easy.

Eric: He was my friend.

zolloz89: Good.

zolloz89: That'll be it.

TwistedTri: be it for your turn all right uh since i have nothing to do on this turn ball...

nicole: um well i mean i'm gonna like walk in as well um do we have rules on how far we can walk...

TwistedTri: you. so one 30 feet is one one movement, or you can take both of both of your things can be movement for a total of up to 60. yeah,

Eric: Did Ball see what happened to us?

nicole: okay...

Eric: Or did Ball not get... Okay.

TwistedTri: she would have seen,

TwistedTri: she would have seen the scorpion come out and she would have seen grok try and smash it i...

zolloz89: Fry. Come on.

nicole: so...

TwistedTri: mean successfully smash it...

nicole: uh i see three doors...

Eric: Matt's going to tell us what's behind two... No. It's going to be the Monty...

zolloz89: He's going to eliminate one door.

Eric: The Monty Hall problem.

nicole: so how much how many feet is each square excuse...

TwistedTri: five feet...

Eric: Bless you.

nicole: me sorry okay so i've gone five...

nicole: 15 20 25 30 oh that's 20 okay um i think what i want to do is a perception check but i want to like see if i can hear anything through the door yeah...

TwistedTri: so just a reminder this game is not so much about rolling for that but you just tell me what you want to do and i will tell you the answer so you you describe you describe what you're doing and we'll go from there...

nicole: i'm so yeah so i like quietly like walk over there kind of like tread over to the door uh and i just kind of like lean my head almost all the way up to the door to see if i can hear anything on the other side well...

TwistedTri: it is dead quiet on the other side of the door okay...

nicole: that was my turn...

Eric: Daryl wants to see if he can see anything on the floor in relation to, like, anything that he can notice. There's not really much else around.

TwistedTri: i will tell you that uh on the floor you just all you can really see on the floor is the obviously there's a pressure plate that that grok is standing on uh but that obviously looks like nothing now as the scorpion came out from underneath it and uh nothing else bad happened so you can't really make out if there's anything else with that uh and then i guess since you're holding the light uh you do happen to notice that on you get the on this wall over here like right along the floor there's like these strange almost like drag marks along the floor i...

Eric: Okay. So, I think I'm going to walk over perhaps that one.

Eric: But not all the way over. Just... I'm going to stay a little bit clear of the drag marks.

Eric: And I think what I might do... Let's see what I have for anything here.

Eric: Does anything I have have any substantial... Like, could I try to, like, toss something over into the drag marks? Let's see if it triggers anything without me having to step on it.

TwistedTri: mean you could pick up a you could pick up a stone from the floor or something if that's what you want to do it...

Eric: I think that's what I'm going to do is pick up a stone and toss it over towards the drag marks and see if that triggers anything.

TwistedTri: does not trigger anything but it has the distinct sound of metal there...

Eric: All right. So, that's probably end my turn.

zolloz89: Now that I've stepped on this pressure plate, are there other pressure plates in the room that I can see? Now I kind of know what one looks like. Okay.

TwistedTri: are not there are not nope...

Eric: Then you can see.

zolloz89: Yeah. Until I move one square.

TwistedTri: you all die all right...

Eric: Everyone's dead.

zolloz89: I think I'm going to be...

zolloz89: Ball, did you hear anything through the door? Should we go through that one? Should we go through that one? Is it safe? Peek through?

nicole: i didn't hear anything my guy i mean i didn't hear anything so sure i mean i'm not scared either way so like let's just you know...

zolloz89: And Daryl, what do you think is going on down there? Where should we go?

Eric: I tossed a stone and heard something metal. So, it clanged to get something. So, I'm speculating that it's either going to be a trip plate. I also see these weird drag marks that appear to look like they're going towards this, you know, over next to this wall. So, I don't know if something was dragged into the room down here or from the room into here. But,

Eric: I'm guessing there's some pressure plate somewhere over here because it's something metallic.

nicole: okay...

zolloz89: Um... I think Ball's just going to open this door there.

zolloz89: He's like, oh, whatever. That's it. He's just going to go over and open the door. And then, like, take a look in.

nicole: oh...

TwistedTri: so as, uh, as you open the door, i'm gonna need you to give me a deck. save please. oh,

zolloz89: You got it.

TwistedTri: i gotta select you.

nicole: no he's...

TwistedTri: i gotta select your character there, nope...

zolloz89: I'm mighty, so it's good.

TwistedTri: that i don't know why that's rolling for you i need to give you that and then we're gonna use the request to check button instead all...

Eric: There we go.

zolloz89: But I got a 20.

Eric: That's a good roll.

nicole: like no i'm i'm good with that one i'm i'm good with that one oh...

TwistedTri: right there we go that is not a 20 uh so as you open the door there was a trip wire behind it uh that was attached to a sling and a huge rock comes hurtling out of the wall straight in front of you and it's going to do six points of damage the...

zolloz89: That's not a 20.

zolloz89: That's a lot of damage.

zolloz89: I'm just going to, like, look back to everybody. I did damage already. And say, there's a...

Eric: All...

zolloz89: There's a trap on this one. And I've got a headache now. And my turn.

TwistedTri: good news is that you can't the good news is you tripped it once so there's there's nothing else in that room to uh to get hurt on there so all right ball...

nicole: um...

nicole: i mean i guess like now that that one's been triggered i'm just gonna walk down here...

nicole: i'm gonna take one step inside the door quiet why can't i move but...

TwistedTri: because you're on top of grok, so just use the arrow key there you go all right. so as you? uh, you can't see in the room because you don't have light yet. so, uh, you, you can't tell what's inside the room yet. uh,

nicole: i have another thing i can do right well...

TwistedTri: you moved. yeah, so you can certainly take more movement if you want to. no, if you want to light a torch, yes, you absolutely can light a torch, yep all...

nicole: no i was gonna light a torch beep beep beep beep beep light okay okay...

TwistedTri: right you see this room that on the wall is etched thousands of tiny carved tally marks almost like a prisoner's endless record and in the corner of the room you see what looks to be like a small palm-sized wooden icon of a desert saint whose edges have been worn smooth by touch well...

nicole: i feel like i'm still falling back into old habits. but part of me like: do i recognize the, the rune, the um, the goddess thing, god thing? oh,

TwistedTri: you're a little too far away it's so again palm size laying on the floor okay...

nicole: okay, but i've done my things. i can't do anything else. so, uh okay, turn girl, you're up, killer...

Eric: right. I'm going to walk, like, so I'm adjacent to this door. And, I'm going to, without going directly in front of the doorway, I...

Eric: want to see if I can drop another stone or if there's something heavier I can drop on the, you know what, I'm going to open the door. But,

TwistedTri: all...

Eric: I'm going to stay not in front of it. I'm almost going to, like, I'm not, like,

TwistedTri: right and nothing appears to happen...

Eric: that's going to be it for me, I think. Like,

zolloz89: I'll go pick up... I'll go touch the thing. What the hell?

TwistedTri: okay so it is a it is a an uh an item that you can pick up i have that set up so you can pick it up yourself it...

zolloz89: I'll go grab it. Or look at it. And look at it first.

zolloz89: It's not, like, sitting on one of those pressure plates that I was sitting on. It doesn't appear to look trapped or anything crazy. I...

TwistedTri: is it is not it is not trapped uh if you would like to pick it up and take it you may it is worth two silver pieces yeah...

zolloz89: picked up the wooden thingy.

zolloz89: And then, can I kind of look, like, more closely at all the, like, marks on the wall?

TwistedTri: you can see that they are again there's thousands of tally marks in this room but they seem to be uh organized by groupings so you you you could probably imagine this wasn't just a single uh a single person's tally marks but this room has been used many many times over the course of history uh to hold on to somebody all...

zolloz89: That's...

zolloz89: cool. I'm going to basically end my turn, but I'm going to use my axe to etch in one more one tally. And, like, make a joke that they got another one. And points to his, like, injured face.

TwistedTri: right sounds good all right um so as you all are kind of still kind of looking around you see uh a corner of your eye this ghost kind of passed through the wall and it just kind of floats there and hovers and it's weeping all...

zolloz89: Beat.

TwistedTri: you're up all...

nicole: yeah hold on...

Eric: the famous words of the Ghostbusters, get her.

TwistedTri: right go for it ball...

nicole: okay sorry typing fast...

TwistedTri: the answer to that is it is unknown at this point but it does not appear to be...

nicole: okay uh well i'm going to does the ghost see us yet because we're like in the room okay...

TwistedTri: the,

TwistedTri: the ghost is completely distracted in its whatever is going on and it's weeping. it's completely distracted.

TwistedTri: it just seems it just floats around and you can see it. sometimes it moves, sometimes it goes around, sometimes it goes back in through the wall, sometimes it comes back out. it's just, it's kind of just all over the place in this corner and again just weeping and moaning it...

nicole: all...

nicole: right well i'm feeling kind of silly so i'm gonna kind of walk over that direction i'll be like uh what's got your your panties in a bunch there my uh see-through friend interesting...

TwistedTri: does not respond it doesn't even it doesn't even attempt to recognize that you're in the room...

nicole: is that my, but those are my two things. i moved and then i.

nicole: i talked to it and turn oh...

TwistedTri: yep...

Eric: So,

Eric: what I'm going to do is, I am going to, what's considered near and what's considered close to me. Like, what's,

TwistedTri: so close is like melee so within five feet near is 30 feet...

Eric: for me to measure here.

Eric: I am going to, I'm...

Eric: going to cast, I'm going to target the ghost and I'm going to cast turn undead.

TwistedTri: it's already undead okay...

Eric: And, yeah, but it says, you rebuke undead creatures, forcing them to flee.

Eric: You must present a holy symbol to, you know, do I want to do that or do I want to try to communicate? I...

TwistedTri: or you can just ignore it uh...

Eric: don't know. I feel better about just ignoring it. Oh, the ball, I just heard ball try to talk to it. And, and it didn't seem to respond back. I'm...

Eric: going to cast undead on it.

Eric: Now, could I use luck?

TwistedTri: why did you not uh not roll well that...

Eric: I didn't do it yet. So, well, let me, let me just do a normal roll.

Eric: I'd say I did not roll well.

TwistedTri: is a. that is a fail, and it's not a critical fail. so, since we're casting spells, uh, normally you would lose that spell for the whole day now. but, uh, because our one house rule is: until you cast it successfully the first time, uh, you can get another chance to cast that on your next turn. but that would be your. you can't do it twice in one turn.

Eric: Could I try to use luck and then cast it again? Or,

TwistedTri: no, you, you lost that one there. so i i mean i guess you can spend luck to re-roll it. yes, you could do that...

Eric: right. So, let me use my inventory,

Eric: luck.

Eric: I'm going to use one of my luck. I'm going to be down to two.

Eric: And then, how to re-roll that.

Eric: I just go to spells and toggle last spell.

zolloz89: Do it again.

TwistedTri: yeah you're gonna have to go you're gonna have to hit that yeah there you go you got it...

Eric: Here we go.

Eric: And we'll try again.

Eric: Oh, that is a critical failure.

zolloz89: Rip the dream.

Eric: It looks like it was just a regular failure, I guess.

nicole: no the...

TwistedTri: just a regular fail oh that's that's just one...

Eric: So, I guess that's going to be, does that count as two turns?

Eric: I am going to, I'm going to see if I can, I don't want to get too far away from the rest of the party. So, I'm going to go sort of stand next to ball, but clearly on the other side of ball. So, let me, I'm still in measure.

nicole: other side from the ghost...

Eric: Yeah, I don't want to be next to, let me get rid of this. I don't want to get rid of this.

TwistedTri: you had measure tool on so you got to go back to regular...

Eric: What's the regular? Is it just,

TwistedTri: it's the four corner square...

Eric: I'm going to stand sort of between, I'm going to stand so balls between me and the ghost.

nicole: wiener you'll...

zolloz89: I can't wait until Grog's out of this room. Being like, oh, shit, there's a ghost.

TwistedTri: grok it's your turn it...

Eric: My turn.

zolloz89: And Grog is going to do that exact thing.

nicole: be like oh wait a minute...

zolloz89: He's going to get to the door and be like,

nicole: wait what that's...

zolloz89: what the hell is that?

zolloz89: Let's go up here.

zolloz89: Doesn't seem like it's moving or, like, it's just crying. Kind of just standing, like, standing, air quotes. It's, like, still in that space. Kind of being. Yeah.

TwistedTri: it's just kind of floating there yeah like i said sometimes sometimes it it moves over sometimes it goes like through the wall and it comes back out but it's generally staying like in this area here all...

zolloz89: Okay.

zolloz89: Can I. Is this top door open? It looks like it is open. Okay. Um.

zolloz89: Yeah. Then that's going to be it. See what the ghost does. If anything. Let somebody else with the light source go on.

TwistedTri: right you're up...

nicole: me um all right well i...

nicole: guess i'm trying to figure out like uh you know new colleagues new friends like what are we do you guys care about this ghost like do you just want to you know doesn't seem to be too concerned with us all...

zolloz89: Yeah. If we. If it's not into us. We don't need to. We don't need to fuck with no ghosts.

nicole: right well then i concur a girl any thoughts let's...

Eric: I can try my next turn to see if I can get it to go away with that spell again. Or we could just carry on. It doesn't, um, 50-50 on it.

nicole: let's just carry on.

nicole: so i moved out. that was 10 feet and i can go 30, so i'm going to stop there.

Eric: Alrighty.

TwistedTri: you can go another 30 if you want...

nicole: well, i want to peek around this corner and see what i can see.

nicole: oh wow, that's not a whole lot. so i've gone 35, five other stairs. is that what i see?

TwistedTri: they are...

nicole: okay, um, hey, yo, yo guys, um y'all, come down here. uh, we got, we got some choices to make, and that's my turn, mm...

TwistedTri: all right girl.

Eric: I am going to,

TwistedTri: so keep in mind, you're the last one with light, and if you leave that, you're gonna. if you go too far, you're gonna leave grok without any light. well,

zolloz89: I'll live.

Eric: um,

TwistedTri: i'd say, if you go as far as ball went, grok will be completely in the dark...

Eric: I am going to go,

Eric: that didn't want to be where I wanted it to.

Eric: Fall in the dark now.

TwistedTri: he's good grok's okay you...

Eric: I mean, uh, rock is good.

Eric: I, ooh, we have quite a few choices here.

zolloz89: I...

nicole: -hmm...

Eric: I don't want to go any further, because I don't want the light to go away.

zolloz89: mean.

TwistedTri: can go one more and grok stays in the light i'm actually brad you can go one more yet from...

zolloz89: Yeah. You're so good.

Eric: I made a move. Now, I want to just look down this hallway, which appears to be a dead end.

nicole: mm-hmm...

Eric: And is there anything here?

TwistedTri: your viewpoint right now there's nothing you can see uh but on your next turn if you want to walk down there and see if there's anything you can certainly do that uh...

Eric: Does that conclude my turn, or could I still, like, toss a rock down there or something?

TwistedTri: how far did you move? that was more than 30 feet, right,

TwistedTri: all right.

Eric: Yeah, that was 50 feet. So, no,

Eric: I'm done.

TwistedTri: so that's that you did a double move there.

TwistedTri: so all right, grok...

Eric: Yeah, so I'm done. What...

zolloz89: Oh, Jesus. Christ.

zolloz89: I guess he'll do another move before and...

zolloz89: just be ready.

TwistedTri: ball...

nicole: that's me um all right friends i see stairs i see a door what what which way are we like are we feeling lucky...

zolloz89: I'm going to chime up and say, not really. And then, like, point to his forehead again.

nicole: i...

zolloz89: Yeah.

nicole: think what i'm gonna do, grok, i'm gonna walk, i'm gonna step right over you for a minute and just see, because there's this other. okay, so that looks like there's not a hole. okay, so this appears to be another dead end. oh, oh, there's somebody. oh, okay, um, y'all, y'all, there's somebody up ahead.

nicole: i think it.

Eric: does it look like?

nicole: i mean it looks like an alien, i mean it looks like a, the same little symbol that you, and i look like girl an...

TwistedTri: so what you what you can see with what little light you have is uh an ancient soldier standing at attention can't...

nicole: ancient soldier like a statue or an actual like...

TwistedTri: tell from where you're at and the amount of light you have...

nicole: okay well y'all i'm gonna i'm gonna just like walk up there and see see what's going on up here um...

zolloz89: I got you back.

nicole: so that was 15 feet so i'm gonna walk up and get like a real good close look at this ancient soldier um matt what what do i what do i see now that i'm closer...

TwistedTri: you can see that it is a gaunt face almost skeleton like but there is still maybe dried or petrified skin still in the bone uh it's clearly not alive yet it does move as though it's alive it is not hostile at this point uh but it does not speak i...

nicole: okay i'm gonna speak to it and see the response so oh hey hey you what's uh what what's going on why are you just hanging out in here whose...

TwistedTri: guard the tomb i...

nicole: tomb well...

TwistedTri: guard the tomb i...

nicole: that's not very helpful is the uh the tomb over this way this way right over here...

TwistedTri: guard the tomb you've...

nicole: well i'm gonna assume that this door is the tomb uh but i think i've gone as far as i can go i've gone 40 feet yeah 45 feet okay that's my turn boop...

TwistedTri: gone 40 45 feet all right so girl uh dural and grok you have no idea what happened down at the end of the hall yes...

nicole: oh...

Eric: I'm going to move 30 feet.

Eric: Now I see this thing that appears to be undead.

Eric: I'm going to try to cast my spell on it.

Eric: So I can do that now, I think.

Eric: Alright, once a turn.

TwistedTri: you can cast it once a turn all...

Eric: What the heck? Are these dice rigged? I'm going to use luck again.

Eric: Inventory. Abilities. I'm using the luck.

Eric: I eat one.

nicole: my god you're batting a thousand over there...

Eric: This is terrible.

Eric: I might ask Matt to roll for me.

zolloz89: This guy did it.

Eric: There we go.

TwistedTri: right.

TwistedTri: so that means i have to make a charisma check against your spell casting. so what is your spell casting, you see..?

nicole: oh...

Eric: Where is that? That should be my abilities. My AC is 12. I...

TwistedTri: yeah what's the so i need to do that one selected and we need to do a charisma check so...

Eric: don't know if there's a different spell cast. Oh,

Eric: you suck.

TwistedTri: that is going to prob. that is going to be a success on my part. i passed the charisma check,

TwistedTri: so he remains and then that spell was successful. so you cannot cast that now until you've had a full night's rest hold...

Eric: Yeah.

Eric: Alright. Sounds good. Um, that's my turn.

TwistedTri: on a minute. okay,

TwistedTri: i'll get it in the morning, that's fine. they had nowhere to go with stuff. yeah, i'm sure. okay,

TwistedTri: they just didn't come around enough. take care of it in the morning. no worries, we just got plowed out.

zolloz89: Hell yeah.

TwistedTri: apparently they filled in the bottom of our driveway. well,

zolloz89: Nice.

Eric: Oh,

nicole: no i...

Eric: you mean you got plowed in.

TwistedTri: yeah, well, yes,

TwistedTri: all right.

Eric: Yeah.

TwistedTri: uh so,

Eric: Two opposites.

Eric: Who...

TwistedTri: grok, it's your turn, what? what do you want to do so..?

zolloz89: I'm going to get close enough so I can get a better look at this guy. Thing. I...

TwistedTri: you see the same thing that that ball saw a a uh gaunt skeletal looking creature with skin maybe petrified or dried still on the bone wearing ancient soldiers armor uh...

Eric: is...

zolloz89: imagine we could hear what Baller's saying.

zolloz89: Possibly. Yeah.

TwistedTri: yeah i would i yes i would imagine you heard it...

nicole: wasn't trying to be quiet...

zolloz89: Why do you need to guard the tomb?

nicole: it's not a tumor...

zolloz89: Hell yeah.

TwistedTri: fantastic and what does he do i...

nicole: and what does he do yeah...

Eric: your daddy? What does he do?

zolloz89: Who do you guard the tomb from?

TwistedTri: guard the tomb okay...

zolloz89: You guys, I think you guard the tomb.

nicole: yeah this this guy's not very helpful like hey...

zolloz89: And I'm going to sling my axe behind me and pick up my chain. And then I'll be my turn.

TwistedTri: i...

Eric: I'm wondering if that ghost had any ideas whose tomb it was.

nicole: so i mean he guards the tomb, but he's not doing a whole lot. i'm right here at the door, so i'm just gonna pop that open and i look back and i'm like you, guard this tomb, this one right here.

nicole: all right, well, still not helpful. all right, my guy, good luck with that, and i'm just gonna like walk in. oh lord, there's three doors in here. what's up with all the doors, uh...

TwistedTri: guard the tomb you're...

nicole: well i know better than to like walk off too far by myself so um i was like hey yo yeah come come come in this way...

Eric: Alright. So Dural is going to walk.

TwistedTri: gonna hit the boundary there so you have to go around yeah there you go...

Eric: Alright.

Eric: So you went south, right?

nicole: me accurate i...

zolloz89: Yeah.

Eric: Yeah.

Eric: Oh, God. A lot of doors here.

Eric: Alright. I am going to move.

nicole: wasn't i wasn't lying...

Eric: I'm going to go...

Eric: 30... I can't. Once I move here, that's it. I'm going to get... Walk in front of the door, I guess, in the middle.

Eric: Or the one south of us.

TwistedTri: okay...

Eric: And that's going to be my turn.

Eric: I'm going to take a quick fire break here.

zolloz89: We're in a new little room with a bunch of doors. I think Brock is looking around on the floor.

TwistedTri: grok does not see any anything that looks like a pressure plate like he stepped on before nothing nothing looks out of place uh it looks just you know it looks normal...

zolloz89: Ten more feet.

zolloz89: And it's just a normal room looking room. Nothing special.

TwistedTri: normal normal normal room yep i...

zolloz89: Is...

nicole: i'm just wondering what we gotta do to get this guy to engage with us...

zolloz89: there first aid?

zolloz89: Is there first aid in Shadow Dark?

zolloz89: Like a quick little deal.

TwistedTri: don't recall if there's first aid let me let me uh look at the texts i...

zolloz89: I don't remember.

zolloz89: Consult the tomes.

TwistedTri: mean there are there are potions and stuff you can buy but i don't know let me i'm gonna have to google that one because i don't know an easy way to find that in the book i...

zolloz89: Yeah. Yeah. There's potions.

TwistedTri: think, if you were the, there's a background that lets you do that, and then there's the stabilize. but i don't think there is a first aid. so with resting, if you were to rest for the night, uh you, you would be able to. if you got a full night's rest,

zolloz89: You'd heal a little bit.

TwistedTri: you get your hit points back.

zolloz89: Yeah.

Eric: What happened here? What did we miss?

TwistedTri: uh, grac,

zolloz89: I asked the first thing about first aid.

TwistedTri: grac was asking if there was a way to do first aid on himself, since he's a little low on hit points all...

Eric: I can try to... Okay. Granted, my casting has not been great. I can try to do a cure wounds.

nicole: everything yeah with the casting you've had so far dude like you're gonna end up killing him on accident he's gonna have like a third arm when you're done...

zolloz89: I think it's just, like, best I can find. And it's just, like, hey, man, like, you can kind of treat some wounds, but it wouldn't be, like, healing or anything. So, okay. I think I'm just going to go, like, look at the doors over here.

TwistedTri: right they look like like sturdy sturdy doors they are not locked uh but it is a set of double doors...

zolloz89: Would there be any way to determine if they were possibly linked to another sling or trapped in someone? All...

TwistedTri: uh you can inspect the door and knowing what you know from the last door this these two doors do not look or appear to be trapped in any way...

zolloz89: right. I'm going to call that out to the group that these ones are not trapped as best as my head wound can determine.

nicole: yep well...

TwistedTri: take that take that worth of grain of salt but uh...

Eric: That thing that you picked... The thing that you picked up in the other room, do you still have it? I mean, because clearly there was a weapon blocking that room.

Eric: Like, preventing people from getting in. I'm wondering what the guard would say if you showed him that.

TwistedTri: oh i'm sorry it's my turn i'm i'm eating away at your torch time i didn't realize it was my turn all right ball all...

nicole: so dural's looking in that door grax looking at that door oh...

nicole: god i don't know...

Eric: I'm assuming this thing's badass. Because he's clearly ancient.

Eric: And he's around still. So, so...

zolloz89: So...

nicole: yeah you know what uh dural i'm gonna step up to where you are and i'm gonna open that door so...

TwistedTri: right and you see another one of those ancient looking guards i...

nicole: i start in and i'm just like: what's up my guy? oh gosh, hold on arrow keys. yeah,

TwistedTri: guard the tomb i...

nicole: yeah, your buddy does that too. i heard that. um, what is it? the tombs over this way, is that? is this what the the way the tomb is? yeah,

TwistedTri: guard the tomb and...

nicole: you're useless. um, yeah,

zolloz89: far, we're dealing with a little bit of symmetry.

zolloz89: There's another statue that's over there. So...

nicole: it's true.

nicole: so i've gone. no, i've gone 20 feet. sorry, so 15 feet and i opened the door. so those are my two things...

Eric: I'm going to sort of go...

TwistedTri: you're leaving grac in the dark oh poor grok...

Eric: I...

Eric: I don't see the...

zolloz89: nobody puts a rock in a corner.

Eric: Hold on. Can I go back?

TwistedTri: that's where you started yep all...

Eric: I'm not quite sure which way to go here.

zolloz89: Maybe the big fancy double doors is to the tomb. Or the tomb is, like, upstairs or downstairs or whatever.

Eric: I'm going to open these doors.

Eric: And I'm going to sort of walk in. Let's just see.

TwistedTri: right. so as you enter this room, you see it's a long, thin room bisected by a shallow trench filled with a white powdery dust. to the south,

nicole: oh no...

TwistedTri: to the south, to the south, you see a halfling standing at what appears to be a like a craft table. just, uh, working away on crafts, uh. and he hears the door open and he looks back and he says: oh, visitors, hello, my...

zolloz89: Or invisible.

Eric: Hi... Hi, friend.

Eric: I'm going to say that... I'm going to tell him... Hi, I'm Durrell. I apologize for barging in. We saw that... You know, this place could provide shelter. We did not mean to intrude. Who might you be?

TwistedTri: name is larry larry green bottle. i am a tinkerer and a crafter and, uh, it's been a long time since i've had somebody, anybody, come and visit me. so, uh, please do feel free to check out. uh, my wares. if there's anything that, uh, that catches your eye,

TwistedTri: i might be willing to part with it for a price, ah...

nicole: yeah...

Eric: So I have a quick question, Larry. Um, just... I'm a bit taken back here. Because, um... We walked in and we... I happen to see an apparition that seemed really, uh... Distraught. And, uh... We're seeing, uh... Apparently, um... Beings that are guarding a tomb. Do you happen to know anything about that?

TwistedTri: you saw the ghost yes she has been known to wander the corridors weeping and wailing uh mourning her her lost love i...

Eric: Okay. And who... Do you know who the guards are guarding the tomb of?

TwistedTri: can't say for sure they've been here as long as i have. but if you don't mess with them, they won't mess with you. but i i have to believe that maybe at some point in the past the room beyond the double doors may have been a tomb chamber and and grave robbers, uh, over the years have maybe come and taken taken out what's what's been here, i i don't know. for as long as i've been here, there's never. i've never found a tomb.

Eric: Uh-huh. How long have you been here?

nicole: but have you looked...

TwistedTri: i've. i've lived here probably, i don't know, 15, 20 years. it's really hard to tell time time down here. well..,

Eric: Okay. All right. Well, there's... Just so you're not scared, we have... There's a few more of, uh... My party that are... That are in here. Um... We can certainly... Great.

TwistedTri: please please come in and and sit around my table and and again have a look at at uh what i have to offer if there's anything that that you see that catches your eye you please you let me know and and we'll we'll make a deal...

Eric: Um... I think I'm going to confer with my colleagues. Larry, uh... Thank you. Um... Give us just a second here. And with that, I'm going to end my turn.

zolloz89: Yeah, I'll go in.

zolloz89: And as soon as I enter, I say, name's Grok. Nice to meet you, Larry.

TwistedTri: very nice to meet you too, grok. i see that. uh, you have a head wound, did you? uh,

TwistedTri: did you catch the trap in that front room?

nicole: are...

TwistedTri: i wasn't me, i didn't put it there, that's, that's long been there. but, uh, when i first scouted this place out, i looked in every room. i checked every door to see what was safe and what wasn't, and i knew that something bad was behind that door. so well, tell me, though, what did you find inside the room? i have to know, oh...

zolloz89: I sure did. It's crafty work there, friend.

zolloz89: I, like, jab him in the side with my elbow. It's like, you should take credit if somebody says something like that to you. Um, I found a little wooden statue.

TwistedTri: may i see it this...

zolloz89: Yeah, and he brings it out of his bag and holds it out for him to take a look at.

TwistedTri: is this is very interesting i this must have been as you probably figured out that room that room is is long ago used as a uh a holding cell of sorts uh for people as they were passing through the region uh being transported to a more secure place of holding and i'm betting that this is probably a it looks like some sort of icon to uh to a deity of some sort uh that maybe one of the inmates had uh if you're willing to part with it i i would certainly be willing to to buy that uh from you...

zolloz89: Uh, yeah, sure. And I'll look at some of the stuff that he has or whatnot. Is that the little icon?

nicole: we sure we want to sell it.

zolloz89: Is that the store? I mean, you're not here.

nicole: damn it, jerk, not the mama.

Eric: You're not my mom.

Eric: Oh,

nicole: well..,

zolloz89: Um, I'm the baby. Gotta love me. Uh,

zolloz89: I certainly should try and probably maybe have some healing herbs, huh?

Eric: no, kids.

Eric: Looks like we'll need another Timmy.

TwistedTri: uh, so the that that icon room. you've probably already figured that out, but it is a shop. you can, uh, double click on it, open it up and you can. now, this is one thing i don't fully understand yet, because i haven't done this. uh, in game, i don't know if that will automatically subtract money for it from your character. if not, please make sure that you do subtract, uh, the appropriate amount.

TwistedTri: i will trust you to to deal with the shopping experience as appropriate, i'll...

zolloz89: Yeah.

zolloz89: Um,

zolloz89: yeah, Larry, as you may have noticed, and he points to his head again, uh, I might need, uh, I might have a use for some of those healing herbs. How much did you think you could part for this, uh, this little statuette, and statuette for a little barter?

TwistedTri: tell you what i will give you i will give you two healing herbs for the statue all...

zolloz89: He's gonna just say, it sounds great. I don't need another one of these scars on my face. And hands it over.

zolloz89: And it's gonna grab a couple of herbs. And if it doesn't, I'm gonna buy them, I'm gonna do the test, and then I'm gonna give you my money back for the two.

zolloz89: It took the two away automatically.

TwistedTri: right so go ahead and give yourself two that's good to know give yourself the two silver pieces back and then just get rid of the um the statue okay...

zolloz89: Yeah, I probably should have just hit sell treasure. I'm gonna test that. I'm gonna sell it. It gives me two. Perfect.

TwistedTri: fantastic i love how that works i know...

zolloz89: Automation, baby!

zolloz89: I just gonna kind of look back, um, add Daryl and kind of motion over. There's, there's a little bit of basic adventuring equipment here, if, if we need some. Um,

Eric: I have a question for more of you, Matt. Is the store independent of Larry, or is it Larry's store?

TwistedTri: yeah it's larry's larry's story so he's a tinkerer uh and he when he does leave he does pick up things uh so there are things that he's made things that he's picked up maybe things that other travelers have traded with him over the years i...

Eric: So if Larry were to become disconnected from life, could we just take everything?

zolloz89: I mean, that, that is how murder works.

TwistedTri: mean i mean you could.

TwistedTri: that goes against your alignment, just fyi,

Eric: That's...

Eric: I'm a neutral.

TwistedTri: yeah...

Eric: I'm a... I'm neutrally aligned. But... I know... I don't know... I mean...

zolloz89: That's not very neutral of you.

Eric: I mean... Paul was stealing shit. So...

TwistedTri: well ball's also chaotic so yeah...

Eric: Yes.

Eric: No, what I'm saying is... Paul could do it. Um... No, um... I think...

nicole: i'm also like in two rooms away...

Eric: I know. No, I know. Um...

TwistedTri: ball has no idea that you guys are chit-chatting with with larry over here...

Eric: By the way, that's a heck of a name, Larry, because... You got Dural. Um...

Eric: Let's see.

Eric: Whose turn is it now?

zolloz89: Game master's turn.

TwistedTri: it's game master there you go you guys gotta nudge me when that happens because i forget that i'm in the middle of the order there ball you're up...

nicole: well, i have no clue what's going on over there,

nicole: but i think i'm gonna like walk back up here to the door and be like yo, guys, like where the crap are you?

TwistedTri: you do not you...

nicole: who the hell's larry all..?

Eric: We're over here with Larry.

zolloz89: He's,

zolloz89: he's in a leisure suit.

Eric: It's Larry.

Eric: Leisure suit Larry.

TwistedTri: got to take one more step well...

Eric: Larry is Balky's friend. His cousin.

nicole: right well i just moved twice so that was my okay...

TwistedTri: if you want to move because that was 35 feet if you want to move up to the shop and if you want to have a shopping experience too you can certainly you have enough movement and then shopping is a i'm not going to charge you an action to to do your shopping...

nicole: well, can you make it my turn again?

nicole: thank you...

TwistedTri: seriously yes uh...

TwistedTri: go go anywhere adjacent to it yep all right so while you're shopping there so i think you can shop when it's not your turn duro what do you want to do here well...

Eric: All right. So I want to also check out Larry's goods. So I'm next to the table here. And, um... I also want to ask Larry first. You had mentioned you scouted this whole place. And... Two questions. Are there any other rooms that we should be aware of? Question number one. And question number two. Is there anything that anybody has given to you in the course of their travels that you bumped into in here?

Eric: It is... It is notable.

TwistedTri: the the main reason that i the main reason that i came here was there's a legend there are a couple legends uh in the area uh specifically about statues um and like old very old relics and i have scoured this place top to the bottom and i've not been able to find it and there is a center room in this place which is locked doors are locked on both sides and i have yet to find a key to get into that room i i again i feel like i've scoured this place but you know my maybe my adventuring skills are getting rusty...

Eric: Did you find any successful way to talk to the ghost?

TwistedTri: no i i really the ghost makes me not feel so good i i i try to avoid it when i see it it's never bothered me and i try not to bother her...

Eric: Fair enough.

Eric: Those doors that are locked, do they appear to have regular keys on them? Or are they shaped uniquely?

TwistedTri: they. they appear to have a skeleton key like opening. you know that typical, typical key lock. it doesn't look like it's anything fancy or anything like that. if that's what you're asking,

Eric: And you said there's two locked doors? All...

TwistedTri: there's one to the north and one to the south of that room all...

Eric: right. I am going to... Since I moved 35 feet to get over here,

Eric: I might buy a ration. Let's see if I actually have enough to do it.

TwistedTri: right so you shop and we'll move it on to grok then well...

zolloz89: Uh,

zolloz89: Larry, if we, if you give us a doodle of this outpost, like the layout and, and, and whatnot of all the scouting you've done, we can help you find the key. If, if you, uh, kind of want to split some, split some loot.

TwistedTri: i don't really have a written map of this place, i just know, i just know my way in. it's very, you probably noticed, quite symmetrical, uh. so if you leave this room out the double doors that you came in, uh, the shortest path out is to the north. i don't know how you got here from the north and from the south, but, uh, that north path is the the best way out. if you go to the south, uh, there's another, another chamber with one of the, the guards, uh. and then, uh, just to the west of that is, uh, another uh, rectangular room. that's where the locked door to the center chamber is, uh. and then, you know, back out to the main chamber where you came in. that's really, and obviously there's. there's two rooms above and below. uh, you probably noticed the staircases. i have never been to go look at the other levels. uh, i just kind of stayed here. um, but, uh, but yeah, that's that's pretty much the lay of the land here,

TwistedTri: as i know it...

Eric: So you haven't been upstairs.

zolloz89: What say you to joining us in trying to find this key?

zolloz89: We, we, we can certainly handle ourselves going upstairs or some of the other rooms you haven't been to, but certainly we can use somebody of your expertise in scouting and tinkering.

TwistedTri: i mean i'm not a i'm i'm not a fighter i'm not a fighter i'm i'm more of a run away and fight another day kind of person uh...

zolloz89: I may not, I may not look like it as I'd smear the healing herbs on my forehead, uh, but I'm, I'm, I'm a pretty, pretty good fighter. I'll...

TwistedTri: so you're a level one to three so you can do that d6 yeah there you go uh i have sure i guess i could uh i i i guess i could uh join in with you and um...

zolloz89: take a four.

zolloz89: You just hang back and hold the torch. If you will,

Eric: Oh, do we...

nicole: odour odour otherwise...

zolloz89: I kind of motioned to the group to this Southern door. So that's what we're close by. We...

Eric: want to go back and look at the staircase to go up? When we walk by?

zolloz89: want to leave rooms unexplored on the bottom. First.

Eric: Oh, yeah. No, that's true.

TwistedTri: so it is it it is asking.

zolloz89: Grok's not smart.

TwistedTri: it is asking you guys to re-roll initiative now that we added a new party member. um so, if you guys want to go ahead and do that,

zolloz89: I...

TwistedTri: i will try and figure out what the deal is with that before we play next time...

zolloz89: try,

zolloz89: I tried to click the button that says when clockwise initiative is enabled, only the GM can roll initiative.

Eric: Yeah.

nicole: initiative yeah name these while...

Eric: Yep. Oh,

zolloz89: Clockwise might be the search term we needed.

TwistedTri: okay i'm going to pause that and take a look all...

nicole: you're doing that. i'm going to tell you guys a really funny story. um, i had one of my vendors come into town this week and he brought three friends with them. just so, like we'll make, they decided to make a weekend out of it in new orleans and and so they were at the restaurant two nights in a row. and uh, last night, after i got off work, i ended up meeting them to go do karaoke, and i have a broad repertoire. like i sing a lot of different things. so i sang couple songs, but the last one i sang was little mermaid part of your world and like i get down off the stage and, like you know, super fun. and then one of the guys- his name is patrick like- pulled out his phone and he's like.

nicole: so it's really funny that you picked that song because i just wrapped up playing king triton on broadway and i was like: so sorry that you had to hear me do that like. i'm sure that was painful compared to your broadway crew. i mean a super cool guy. he's really cool. but i was just like i. yeah, i,

Eric: that's pretty cool.

nicole: i had no clue and i was like why did i pick anything else like i..?

zolloz89: Like, damn it.

TwistedTri: right, i i re.

Eric: That's pretty cool.

zolloz89: That's fun.

TwistedTri: i changed that setting and i reloaded it. probably reloaded for you guys too.

TwistedTri: so go ahead and see if you can roll that now. perfect,

zolloz89: Yeah.

zolloz89: Can.

TwistedTri: okay, okay...

Eric: Nice.

nicole: don't even know anything i need to go change my dice i don't even know which one which dice are mine oh...

TwistedTri: that is what i wanted to see puts the game master last we're good okay so the grok it's grok it's still your turn you can you you're...

zolloz89: I motion to the South door. And if we want to go South, we can go South. Otherwise where,

Eric: Yep,

zolloz89: where,

Eric: that works.

zolloz89: where, where, where should we go first?

zolloz89: We can try and go the,

TwistedTri: are you asking are you asking larry or is there so grok as you as you approach that door you hear the faint crying of a baby all...

zolloz89: like the, the group in general.

zolloz89: It's not supposed to be a horror game. Um,

zolloz89: you guys, you guys hear that?

Eric: Hmm, babies.

zolloz89: It sounds like a, it sounds like a baby.

Eric: The other white meat.

nicole: my god...

zolloz89: I'm...

Eric: It's terrible. It's terrible.

nicole: i don't know y'all it's...

zolloz89: going to look at this door as I'd looked at the other doors up above and I'll kind of just, does it appear trapped or locked or can...

TwistedTri: right so as you look at this door it is not it does not appear to be trapped it is not locked uh but again the distinct sound of an infant crying...

Eric: Larry,

zolloz89: I,

Eric: do you know anything about this?

zolloz89: okay. So if the door opens in or out like perfect,

TwistedTri: it opens inward okay...

zolloz89: I'm going to pull it open my chain.

TwistedTri: uh...

zolloz89: So I'm not in front of it.

TwistedTri: the crying now is much louder as you open the door...

zolloz89: I'm not going crazy. Right. Now my turn.

nicole: my turn. i'm gonna be honest, y'all, a baby's probably the scariest thing i could find right now. uh,

zolloz89: Yeah.

Eric: Yeah.

zolloz89: Fuck that ghost.

nicole: yeah, like i like, i vote. we like turn around and go back the other way. um, yeah, it's gonna be honest...

Eric: Does Larry know anything about it? Larry, what's the deal with this baby?

TwistedTri: i've never been through that door i i have always gotten to the door and heard the infant cry and decided i did not want to see what was on the other side of that door all...

nicole: right like who wants to go towards the crying baby like no one nobody wants to go towards a crying baby i...

Eric: Hey.

nicole: mean yeah, bell wouldn't go near, wouldn't go near a crying baby. so uh,

zolloz89: Like, all right,

nicole: yeah, i'm like you know you guys,

Eric: You guys want me to go? Do you guys want me to go in and take a peek? Because we have to find this key. The...

nicole: if you want to, yeah, if you want to my guy, i'm gonna. i'm gonna chill right where i'm at cool, because...

Eric: girl is going to just walk through the doorway.

Eric: It's dark in there for some reason.

nicole: you don't have light...

zolloz89: I bet you ran out of torch.

Eric: I have a torch. Did I run out of a torch? I...

zolloz89: I bet you did.

Eric: did.

Eric: All right, I'm going to light a torch again.

TwistedTri: right. so you took an action to move and you took an action to light your torch.

TwistedTri: lying in the center of the room is what appears to be an ancient crib with an embalmed infant. you can clearly see that this is wrapped like a mummy, but it is. it is wailing like a, like an infant who is hungry or missing its mother's touch you...

Eric: And I feel...

Eric: like we need to get this ghost.

Eric: It's mum. Oh, I think I'm going to... Well, that's it. That's my turn, right? Because I moved and I put a torch, right?

TwistedTri: can you can take a little more movement uh because you only moved what five ten fifteen feet so you can move another another 15 feet if you needed to or wanted to...

zolloz89: Yeah.

Eric: I think I'm going to actually walk backwards, back through the door I came in. I'm going to note that there's a door to the left in that room.

TwistedTri: yep all...

Eric: Or a door to the west.

Eric: Wrong line.

Eric: Hey, guys. There is, like, a mummified baby in there that's crying.

Eric: And there is another door to the west down in that room. I don't know really what to make of any of this.

Eric: That's all I got. But...

TwistedTri: right grok...

zolloz89: We're not feeling the baby.

zolloz89: We, we, we, we, we, we all don't want to go in there. Right. I'm just looking at the three of them.

nicole: yeah i mean yeah yeah i mean i'm not going in there...

TwistedTri: your...

zolloz89: Um,

Eric: I can't really do anything with a dead baby. So,

nicole: wow,

zolloz89: I guess we'll go North then.

nicole: that was, that was quite the line. i can't do anything with a dead baby.

Eric: yeah,

Eric: that's probably not...

nicole: whoa,

zolloz89: It's the clean read. If I ever heard one,

nicole: right,

nicole: lord i...

zolloz89: Uh,

zolloz89: it's two moves and get up by the door and wait for everybody.

Eric: I...

nicole: don't know well i'm gonna go move up north too boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo boo...

TwistedTri: eye yeah there you go...

nicole: oh i guess i can't go in okay that's not letting me go in i have another 55 feet or another five feet matt is there like am i missing something like it's not letting me go through i am missing something okay what am i missing uh...

TwistedTri: yep you're missing you're missing something do you want me to tell you or do you want to figure it out uh...

nicole: do we need the key to go through that door okay...

TwistedTri: nope it is not locked there's that there's a there's a key there's a key mechanic that you're missing here and how it works okay i know you want to open the door uh...

zolloz89: Do you have to open the door?

nicole: do i not fit...

nicole: i want to open the door oh i thought it was like i just tell you um hey...

zolloz89: If you're right next to me, you also don't have a torch anymore. Or if you're through that door or something.

zolloz89: I don't see you.

nicole: larry what's the deal with this door my guy oh...

TwistedTri: that door it should open just fine. so keep in mind: larry does not need light. larry is adjusted to the dark, so he does not need light to see what's going on. you do there, you go,

nicole: my torch expired okay gee no beat oh well...

TwistedTri: so doors can only be unlocked and you can only progress. progress if you have light shining on the door all...

nicole: that don't...

nicole: lock the door all right princesses i'm gonna walk for y'all coming behind me...

zolloz89: Yeah.

TwistedTri: right. so, as you enter this room, uh, you would only have one, one square in right. uh, yeah, uh.

nicole: you're right yeah sorry it's...

TwistedTri: so you see a shallow layer of sand that is pulsing slightly with every footstep,

TwistedTri: almost like living skin whenever anybody walks, and the sand holds a subtle metallic glimmer, as if flecked with grounds of glass that move and undulate through the sand all...

nicole: pulsing with my footstep maybe...

nicole: it's like the baby's sandbox i don't know that's my turn because i did i moved so...

TwistedTri: right dural...

Eric: think I'm going to go... I think I'm going to go...

nicole: girl...

Eric: I think I'm going to go and walk into this room and pick up the baby.

TwistedTri: okay as you as you pick up the as you pick up as you pick up the baby the baby starts to wail this ear piercing scream and you can hardly concentrate on anything else but this uh screaming baby and it is going to join the encounter so...

nicole: oh oh god oh...

zolloz89: Daryl's, Daryl's dead.

nicole: my god guys i told y'all we don't need a baby...

zolloz89: It's not three men and a baby.

TwistedTri: you're now holding. you're now holding this infant in your hand, so you moved in and you picked up the baby. those are your two actions, my friend.

TwistedTri: i mean you have more movement. you have more movement. if you did want to, uh, to move more, you certainly have a little more movement, uh...

Eric: I'm going to...

Eric: move back into the room. What do I have left for movement? Because it doesn't show me the number anymore.

TwistedTri: you're at 40 feet right now so you actually can't do that you'd have to go you'd have to go down one square there you go...

Eric: There we go. That's my turn. Guys, I got some bad news.

TwistedTri: grok you're up...

nicole: involved baby uh...

zolloz89: I, I think,

zolloz89: I think he sees Daryl walking in with the baby that we decided to not go near.

zolloz89: And just like, because,

nicole: -huh so...

Eric: Guys,

zolloz89: you know what?

Eric: I have a kid now.

TwistedTri: so grok now as you enter this room you also see you see the the sand seem to pulse with every footstep you see this metallic glimmer that just undulates through the sand uh as you walk through this room that's...

zolloz89: He picked up the fucking baby.

zolloz89: So the sand is in part of the room. The whole room.

TwistedTri: that's the whole room is covered in this in this sand...

zolloz89: Huh.

nicole: like where's like uh bal and grok are like standing in it now okay...

TwistedTri: yes...

zolloz89: I just see embalmed is next on the,

TwistedTri: how...

zolloz89: the tracker at the top. And I'm like, man, this sucks. Um,

zolloz89: I think he's going to, like, toss out part of his, uh, chain just out in front of him. And so they go onto the floor and, like, kind of see what happens with, like, this band.

TwistedTri: many how many feet out are you gonna throw that out all...

zolloz89: Um, it's got a lash range of 30. So I can just go this whole room if I think, if I think if I want to.

TwistedTri: right.

TwistedTri: so all right.

zolloz89: Like, straight out as a,

TwistedTri: so you're gonna go straight out and drag back as you're dragging the chain back to the sand.

zolloz89: yeah.

TwistedTri: this um eruption happens out of the center of the floor and a a group of biting sand beetles is going to join the initiative now...

nicole: oh lord oh...

nicole: lord...

zolloz89: Biting sand beetles.

zolloz89: That's not good.

TwistedTri: so grok, grok, that's your turn, okay,

zolloz89: That sure is. Embalmed baby's turn.

TwistedTri: the embalmed infant is now being held in durrell's arms and he's going to break free of his wrappings. and, uh, if you've ever been around babies, you know that their fingernails are like razors. uh, and it's going to start to claw at you and...

zolloz89: It's going to get mummied into him and it's going to be, Daryl's going to be the baby.

nicole: oh my god...

TwistedTri: that is going to. he's not going to be able to to hit, so it's going to be a miss on this turn ball. you also now see this eruption of biting sand. beetles come up from the the sand. uh,

nicole: sure do...

TwistedTri: and you also notice. you also notice that as they come up out of the sand, this, that subtle metallic glimmer that you saw, it was probably the beetles running around under the sand. because now, as you move around,

nicole: all right...

TwistedTri: you don't see that, you don't see that glimmer anymore, oh...

nicole: well, grok, my guy, i'm not. i'm not hanging with you fools if you're gonna get babies and beetles all up in here,

nicole: so i'm just gonna walk backwards. yeah,

zolloz89: Well, this is clearly better than the other thing.

zolloz89: As you walk away.

nicole: good, good luck, my guy. good luck, i'm out...

Eric: Everyone's like,

Eric: what the fuck?

TwistedTri: and you,

TwistedTri: and you're gonna leave them in the dark. i love it.

TwistedTri: i love it.

Eric: Everyone's like,

TwistedTri: that's fantastic. well,

Eric: what the fuck?

TwistedTri: larry, he is freaking out. he's gonna make a run for the door. uh, because he, now he can see and hear the baby and you guys are screaming about beetles from the other room, and he does not want to be anywhere where you're at. so he is going out the hall, closing the door behind him and running away all...

nicole: deuces larry oh...

Eric: Hey, Larry.

Eric: Hey, Larry. Come meet my kid.

TwistedTri: right dural...

Eric: Right. I am going to run with the baby.

Eric: Why does it show me my measurement anymore? It's...

nicole: my god what drop the drop the baby drop the baby what are you what are you doing my guy i...

Eric: I want to bring the baby to the ghost.

zolloz89: You're not supposed to drop the baby.

Eric: Yeah. Here we go.

zolloz89: You're not supposed to shake him either, but here we are.

Eric: Wait.

nicole: mean if the baby's clawing at him with razor fingernails then yeah drop the baby the baby's already dead y'all...

Eric: What am I at now? 35...

TwistedTri: that's 35 that's 35 feet...

zolloz89: True? I...

Eric: Can I go back through this door here?

Eric: These doors should already be open, I think.

TwistedTri: larry ran away and closed the doors behind him that's...

Eric: Oh,

Eric: you bastard, Larry. I'm trying to bring the baby back to the ghost. All right. I'm going to open...

nicole: about larry like that...

Eric: I'm going to open the door. Now, that's my move, though, right? That's it. Because I can't do anything else, right?

TwistedTri: it the baby is going to try and uh claw at dural again here that...

zolloz89: hope he does it this time.

Eric: Always got me.

TwistedTri: is a success. for, uh oh,

TwistedTri: that doesn't have the attack on that shoot. that's gonna. um, we'll do the.

Eric: You weren't thinking...

TwistedTri: we'll do the 1d4,

TwistedTri: 1d4 damage on that one all...

Eric: You weren't thinking someone...

Eric: You weren't thinking someone would pick up the baby, were you? Um...

TwistedTri: right so you're gonna take one point of damage and...

Eric: I have here... Abilities... Oh, boy. I don't really have a lot to begin with here.

TwistedTri: that's gonna be their turn rack it's your turn oh...

Eric: I can't... Hold on. Here we go.

zolloz89: He doesn't do anything that I could see, I guess.

zolloz89: Well, I guess I have to light my own torch.

zolloz89: And now I'm going to attack him with my razor chain. Target,

zolloz89: uh,

nicole: steely my guy...

zolloz89: near range, melee attack, and lash. So it's not thrown. I still hold on to it.

zolloz89: Roll me. A good attack. I'll take an 18 plus, whatever.

TwistedTri: that is that's fantastic so that's that that is a hit so uh that will be five five points of damage that is uh you you smash a bunch of them but there are still a few uh kind of skidding around the floor at the moment all...

zolloz89: And five damage.

zolloz89: I'm down with that. But that's the turn.

TwistedTri: right it is the infant's turn again uh and it will again continue to try and scrape and claw at uh dural and...

zolloz89: I didn't write, sorry, I didn't write in my notes.

zolloz89: Daryl picked up the mummy baby like a dummy.

Eric: The baby.

TwistedTri: that's going to be a failure this time again oh wait a minute we forgot i i'm sorry uh on the last round that was successful uh you must also pass a wisdom check so go ahead and give me a dc 11 wisdom check please dural yes...

Eric: All right. Hold on.

zolloz89: It'll be a second before it's my turn. I'm grabbing water.

Eric: A wisdom check? Hold on.

TwistedTri: please dc 11 so...

Eric: Hold on. I can't...

nicole: hold up...

Eric: Hold on. Wisdom.

TwistedTri: you open your character sheet and then go to abilities and just click on the wisdom button. there we go. there we go.

Eric: Wisdom.

TwistedTri: oh you are, you are safe this time, all right, and that is the baby's turn ball. you're up...

Eric: Ty goes to the runner.

nicole: it's me. yeah,

nicole: i mean they're all like my. yeah, like i don't even well, like you're literally gonna just run the baby back to the ghost, like i, the...

Eric: It...

Eric: I... I don't know. I hit... I just... I just figured I didn't want to leave the baby there.

nicole: baby was fine. um, you know, i'm um like i just shut up. um, i'm gonna run back out out this way. oh, hold on, let me open the door. yo grok, my guy, run away from the beatles. uh,

zolloz89: Why?

nicole: we got stuff to do.

nicole: i'm going back this way, y'all,

zolloz89: Yeah. Like beetle stuff.

Eric: Which way did you go south?

zolloz89: We...

Eric: But don't bring that baby back this way. I think I'm probably going to put... Oh,

nicole: south, south, yeah, i...

TwistedTri: and larry is larry is gonna continue to run here uh dural...

nicole: don't blame him...

Eric: my God.

zolloz89: tried to protect Larry.

Eric: Um...

TwistedTri: your turn...

Eric: I'm intrigued to see if this baby belongs to that ghost. But... Part of me is like, I can't die. So...

Eric: I think...

zolloz89: I mean.

zolloz89: You can.

Eric: I mean... No, I can. But, like... I want a... I want a five baby to kill me. Um... I think what I'm going to do...

nicole: drop kick the baby fuck...

Eric: I'm going to dropkick the baby. I'm... I'm going to... I... I'm going to chuck the baby and throw it towards... Just the... What... What... What things came out of that?

TwistedTri: there's.

Eric: Thing? I'm...

TwistedTri: there's a couple needles left, grok. uh, grok took care of most of them with that last attack.

TwistedTri: all right, i need,

Eric: going to chuck the baby towards the other Beatles.

nicole: the baby i'm...

TwistedTri: i'm going to need a check for that,

TwistedTri: so let's uh all...

zolloz89: Hey,

zolloz89: NSA, if you're listening, I'm sorry.

Eric: Someone's going to be the wild card. Um...

nicole: not aren't you neutral i'm the chaotic one...

zolloz89: I'll allow it.

Eric: I am neutral. I...

Eric: I don't know.

zolloz89: No,

zolloz89: we're both chaotic, and he's neutral.

Eric: I'm neutral. I'm the one who grabbed the baby.

TwistedTri: right go ahead and give me that strength check let's see if you can do it all...

TwistedTri: right. so uh, show me with the pointer where you want the baby to be thrown to. you can go, you can throw it up to 15 feet.

TwistedTri: uh yes,

Eric: What's the... What's the pointer? X?

nicole: that's the uh. standard baby checking distance is 15 feet. no,

TwistedTri: 15 feet all...

zolloz89: It's in the rules.

Eric: Uh... I can't...

nicole: i got it. got it, uh...

Eric: How do I do the... To do the pointer again?

Eric: Great. X doesn't seem to be... Showing me anything.

Eric: How about that?

TwistedTri: right so you want that one there okay so you throw the baby and it it lands in the middle and it is wailing and just the echo is reverberating in this chamber now and it's so hard to concentrate while you're in that room it's...

Eric: Yeah. So...

Eric: I'm going to run out of this room...

Eric: Um... Now... Because... And I'm going to go down south towards where Nicky... Went... Or...

TwistedTri: that was that's 15 20 25 yeah...

Eric: I can go probably one more, right? That kosher... If I go diagonal... Yeah. It's...

TwistedTri: yep all...

TwistedTri: right so that's your turn all right the biting sand beetles are going to get their first their first chance at an attack so they're going to swarm rock and try and bite him oh...

Eric: my turn.

zolloz89: Beetle.

zolloz89: Yeah, that'll do it.

TwistedTri: that's going to be successful but it's only going to be it's only going to be one point of damage so go ahead and take uh take one point off...

TwistedTri: these little beetles are kind of crawling all over you biting you what do you want to do here...

Eric: Get the baby.

zolloz89: I think I'm going to kind of just, like. I mean, they're technically still in this space next to me, right? Okay. I'm going to. I'm going to attack him with my razor chain again.

TwistedTri: yes yes okay that...

zolloz89: So, it's still targeted. I've got to hit it from abilities instead.

zolloz89: What do I. All...

zolloz89: right, it's going to be another damn good hit.

TwistedTri: is another hit and that you destroy all the beetles they're dead just...

zolloz89: It's just beetles. They weren't, like, swarming around anything. They were just a bunch of beetles.

TwistedTri: a bunch of this blue green metallic looking beetle yep yep your...

zolloz89: Scarab-ass looking beetles.

zolloz89: 30 feet.

TwistedTri: bombed infant is going to continue to wail and cry but not going to be able to move since it is a infant ball you uh you ran away and you're down in that southern southern chamber...

nicole: huh...

nicole: sure i am, so i've got dural. is that larry? that's,

TwistedTri: dural is south dural is south of you right now oh...

Eric: No... No... That's one of those...

Eric: That's one of the guards.

nicole: that's.

nicole: oh, that's the guard.

Eric: That's one of the...

nicole: okay,

Eric: Yeah.

nicole: oh, wow, i all...

TwistedTri: i can help you i can help you with that uh there i put larry's name on his token so when you find him you'll you'll see him that...

Eric: Larry's going to be like... What the fuck?

nicole: right so i moved how much i think i already moved more than one turn okay yeah so that's my turn girl...

TwistedTri: was that was 40 feet right there...

nicole: noose...

Eric: Alright.

Eric: Why isn't it showing me... The distance?

TwistedTri: again, that might be a setting you have to turn on, which is client to client.

TwistedTri: so you may have to go through and do some settings you've...

Eric: No, I mean...

Eric: It was showing me... It was showing me before I switched to ruler mode. And then when I switched back... Following that... Okay. So I moved 40 feet, it says...

TwistedTri: moved 40 feet yep yeah...

Eric: So that's two... I'm going to just get right up to this doorway.

Eric: But I can't do anything... I can't open the door, right? We'll open the door... Here. But that's it. So could I keep continuing on? Alright.

TwistedTri: opening a door is a free action you can go you can go five more you can go five more feet there you go all...

Eric: Now I'm in this room. There's two doorways. I'm going to end my turn.

zolloz89: Grok is tempted to look into the baby room. But he's not. He's, like, stupid enough to be like, well, we'll come back.

zolloz89: Hey, guys. Beetles are dead.

TwistedTri: right. so you guys have.

nicole: a bomb anything...

TwistedTri: you guys have left the room, so we're going to kick the uh embalmed infant out, unless you decide to go back into the room. uh, so that would make it. that would make it ball's turn ball. as you look into this room, you see that the room has a cracked up. okay, so,

nicole: check...

TwistedTri: since you decided to go run in the room, uh, without looking, you happen to trip a wire that's going across the center of the room. it was buried under the sand. uh, i'm going to need to give. i'm going to need a dc12 dexterity check, please, uh...

nicole: abilities hell...

zolloz89: Be pretty good at that. Hell, yeah.

Eric: So...

TwistedTri: so you, you are able to quickly dodge, uh, a falling piece of debris from the ceiling which would have pinned you to the floor until you were freed by somebody else.

nicole: yeah...

TwistedTri: so as you're now looking around this room, you can see a cracked stone basin that dominates the center. its rim is etched with worn glyphs, uh...

nicole: calic reflexes my friends do...

nicole: i recognize any of the glyph...

TwistedTri: it appears to be some ancient uh dialect that uh you are not familiar with all...

nicole: okay well um...

TwistedTri: right. so that was. that was 15 feet of movement into the room. you still have another 15 feet and you still have another action. if there's anything else you want to do. uh,

nicole: is there anything else around the room...

TwistedTri: yeah, you look at. uh, just to the south of you, you see what appears to be a ring lying on the floor.

TwistedTri: i'm sorry, not a ring, a bangle like a bracelet, a silver bracelet, uh...

nicole: like a lord of the rings ring...

nicole: got it.

nicole: i'm gonna yeah,

zolloz89: And Larry did a piss poor job exploring this place.

nicole: i'm gonna i...

Eric: Well, here's my question.

TwistedTri: so go go go one more north and then you can double click that it's an item you can pick up all...

Eric: Here's my question about Larry. He walks into a place... Decides he's just going to live there. There's a ghost... Two weird fucking guards... And a baby... Crying. Granted, it wasn't weird enough what I did... By picking up the baby and running with it... But...

TwistedTri: as you pick up the as you pick up the bangle uh so go ahead and go one more down where you were where the bangle was...

nicole: sorry i ended my turn can you make it my turn again...

TwistedTri: yeah, go down one more. so as you're bending down to pick up the bangle, you notice that in the the square next to you. so in this square,

TwistedTri: you notice that there there appears to be maybe like a hinge or some sort of mechanism along the this edge of that of the floor tile. but your turn was to move and to pick up the ring.

nicole: uh-huh okay...

TwistedTri: so do you tell everybody else about that? or, uh, are you gonna wait for your next turn to do something about that..?

nicole: well...

nicole: the gang's all here right, uh, everyone except for larry. um, uh,

Eric: It was grumpy.

nicole: yeah, i'm gonna tell, i'm gonna. hey, guys, y'all, there's like something going on right here on the floor there's...

Eric: Alright.

Eric: Can I... Take a peek at those glyphs... To see if I can determine anything... From them?

TwistedTri: yeah you can look to it it's again some ancient language uh none of you are probably familiar with with what it is uh...

Eric: Can I examine the thing that... Paul had seen?

TwistedTri: yeah, so go ahead and back up. uh, back up a. so as you uh as you bend down and you, uh, kind of look, you kind of brush the sand away and you can clearly see the outline of some sort of trap, door or panel or something.

TwistedTri: so that will be your turn. you moved and you, uh,

Eric: Alright.

Eric: Examine.

TwistedTri: cleared away this, this trap door panel. grok has no idea what's going on because he's in in some other room,

TwistedTri: so he comes barreling in it's...

zolloz89: Hey, guys, what's up?

Eric: Hey... There's some trap panel... Yeah.

nicole: like a trap door over here good job yeah...

zolloz89: Killed the beetles.

Eric: There's some panel... Trap door. Awesome.

zolloz89: I'm proud of me, too. Thanks.

Eric: Do you see the baby I tried to steal?

zolloz89: Yeah, that's pretty messed up, man.

nicole: y'all are both messed up uh...

zolloz89: You should go fix that.

zolloz89: What's the dealio? Is this the locked door up to my right? The north?

nicole: we don't know. we haven't gone that far. we are down here with this like trap door thing. uh, you know,

nicole: not yet why don't you give it a go..?

zolloz89: Is it locked? Is it? You tried it yet?

zolloz89: Put my, like, kind of stash my chain, as Indiana Jones does, his whip on his belt. Pulls out his great axe and hits the door with both hands.

TwistedTri: the trap door all right. uh, it wasn't locked.

zolloz89: He's just going to break it.

TwistedTri: you could have, you could have easily lifted it up. uh,

zolloz89: That's fine.

zolloz89: Sure.

TwistedTri: but when you, when you clear away the debris? so..

zolloz89: I just feel like they're just, like, standing around this thing. And he's just like, fuck it, and hits it while they're both, like, kneeled down around it.

TwistedTri: as you clear away the debris you find a key all...

zolloz89: Man, a rusty key?

nicole: yeah...

zolloz89: Good thing it's not my turn anymore.

Eric: Larry did a really shitty job searching this place.

zolloz89: I know.

nicole: all right. well, i want to pick up the key.

nicole: oh oh, sorry, you picked it up.

zolloz89: I'll toss you the key.

nicole: i didn't realize that as long as someone got it, as long as someone got it, that's all that matters,

zolloz89: Yeah, but, uh,

zolloz89: yeah, I picked up the key.

nicole: um you...

zolloz89: If you want to go try and use it, I'll toss it to you. And we'll just play like you have it.

nicole: know like i'm assuming we were looking for a key. so i'm assuming that's the key we were looking for. that might be a dumb assumption. um,

zolloz89: That's pretty cool.

nicole: should we just start trying doors until we see which one it unlocks..?

zolloz89: Yeah, sure.

Eric: Well,

nicole: i'm gonna move up that's what i'm trying to find out you seen that one okay this one's not locked...

zolloz89: I'll toss you the key.

Eric: are these the door? Are any of these the locked door?

zolloz89: I assume that this one, this one is.

zolloz89: This one probably goes back to that weird bullshit in the first room. Whatever that was.

nicole: okay so this one's locked...

TwistedTri: right so this door is locked and the key that you found does unlock it...

zolloz89: Hey. We've solved the locked-the-door puzzle.

nicole: like on 20 oh...

Eric: Oh,

Eric: and the hall on the other side is the one we walked down.

TwistedTri: so uh ball as you look into this room you see it is filled with toppled stone uh and the stone has carvings of intricate lattice patterns maybe uh ceiling tiles from you know decorative ceiling tiles or maybe there were pillars in this room at one time it's really hard to tell uh but along the wall you can also see weather-worn banners that hang uh but its sigil is is unrecognizable to you at the moment but go ahead and give me a uh give me an intelligence check uh...

nicole: i'm super intelligent okay...

zolloz89: Hell yeah, somebody has to be. It's not Grok.

TwistedTri: these, these symbols. uh, on the, they look very, very familiar to you, but you can't place them right now. uh, so you're gonna take a mental picture of that. and the next time you get to elkesh, um, you're gonna, you're gonna talk to. so take a note of these. uh, you're going to talk to somebody on the council and and show them or draw this sigil for them, and i'll, i'll, we'll, we'll role play that part later. uh, but someone at elkesh will absolutely be able to help you figure out what those are. now,

nicole: okay oh...

TwistedTri: you also see that there are a pair of rock hyenas, and as you enter the room, uh, they begin to circle and growl and bare their teeth. no,

zolloz89: As in hyena made out of rock? Or?

TwistedTri: they're like desert hyenas.

TwistedTri: their their breed is, is, is a rock hyena?

zolloz89: Wow, double 14s.

zolloz89: You got it. Just gotta clarify.

TwistedTri: yep, yep...

zolloz89: Made of rock. Not good for Grok.

nicole: my god...

Eric: That's great.

TwistedTri: that's a good one all...

nicole: well i think that these hyenas don't have opposable thumbs so i'm gonna just back out of the room and and shut the door again and...

TwistedTri: right...

nicole: that's not true. well,

zolloz89: What'd you find? I think we could kill hyenas.

nicole: so there's some hyenas in there and yeah, i mean there was a lot of debris and stuff and i, you know, took a mental picture of some things that i want to remember and talk to. you know our advisors back at the pharaoh, but yeah, i just figured i don't want to around with those hyenas. so uh yeah,

nicole: i'm not scared, i just don't want to look around,

zolloz89: I thought you weren't really scared of anything.

Eric: What way do you guys...

zolloz89: All right.

zolloz89: Now we're on the same page with things.

Eric: What way...

nicole: no...

zolloz89: Huh? I...

Eric: What way... What way do you guys want to go? Do you want to go back towards the baby? Or do you want to go...

zolloz89: don't want to go towards the baby, man. He kind of,

nicole: we're not going towards the baby yeah we're not going towards the baby is never going to be the the answer yep...

Eric: Do you want to go to the left?

zolloz89: like, shrugs his shoulders. He's like, nah.

Eric: Alright. That's...

Eric: great. I'm going to go down this path here.

Eric: Oh, I see. I got a few more steps.

Eric: Move the map. There we go.

Eric: It looks like I'm back into the room now... Where the ghost was.

Eric: And that's... That's it for me.

TwistedTri: crock your turn he...

zolloz89: I guess.

zolloz89: Where did Larry go?

TwistedTri: gone...

Eric: I don't see Larry. I think we freaked him out... By me grabbing the baby. And... Mostly that.

TwistedTri: larry larry larry took off and he is he is gone thank...

zolloz89: Hey, Ball?

Eric: Larry's in the wind.

zolloz89: I think Larry left his store.

nicole: should we go get? take all the stuff?

nicole: i think we should i...

Eric: I think we should. Alright.

zolloz89: If we, like,

zolloz89: I know we told Daryl that we shouldn't go by the baby. But now maybe we should go by the baby.

nicole: say we do it...

Eric: So I'm all the way in this other room.

zolloz89: Can we, like, I want to, like, hit the wall a bunch of times to get his attention. And then, like, keep, like, go back. And...

Eric: Alright. So should I... Do you guys want me to head back that way? Or do you guys want me to stay put here?

zolloz89: go that far. And you know what? YOLO.

nicole: i mean we know what happens when we split up so just saying i'm...

zolloz89: Rock hyena.

TwistedTri: you if you guys aren't if you guys aren't going in there then i'm gonna just take them out of the initiative...

nicole: gonna i'm...

nicole: here and we might how...

zolloz89: We might immediately decide to go back in there. I don't know what you're talking about.

TwistedTri: that's okay i'll put them i'll put them back in and we can re-roll their initiative...

nicole: far have i gone...

Eric: Should we check to see what's... Since I...

TwistedTri: that's 60 right there...

Eric: Since I removed the baby from the thing... Should I check to see what's in the room... Like next to the baby's original room?

nicole: okay...

Eric: Right now it's the Game Master. I'm...

nicole: sure...

zolloz89: We can't talk to him anyway. He's quite far away.

Eric: going to just go back... I guess... As far as I can.

Eric: That's 60 feet from me. That's it.

nicole: okay...

TwistedTri: uh, grok, you are again. you now hear the baby crying, wailing in this room. it's very disorienting. you can now see the baby has moved its position, uh,

zolloz89: It has.

TwistedTri: around the store here, and i need you all to give me a constitution check as you're in this room it...

Eric: I'm not in the room.

zolloz89: It's not an injury or a poison, is it?

TwistedTri: is not an injury or poison but please give me a constitution check uh that is going to be a fail so you are going to be frightened for and that is that is you're successful on that one crack but unfortunately for ball ball is going to be frightened for two rounds it...

nicole: but then in the meantime i want to how do i open up the store oh...

zolloz89: What's frightened to mean?

nicole: here we go okay...

TwistedTri: has to do with chicks uh let me bring that up...

zolloz89: I assume it was a check penalty or, like, a penalty to rolling for whatever. But,

TwistedTri: yeah, it's. uh, i think it's. i think it's a penalty to all of your stat rules for that many rounds like your intelligence, your wisdom, your constitution. uh, not your, not your agility, or you're not your decks or your,

TwistedTri: uh you...

zolloz89: oh,

zolloz89: that's disgusting. It's, uh,

zolloz89: let's see.

nicole: okay so i want to i want to steal stuff from the store how do i do that i...

Eric: I'm not in the room.

TwistedTri: should be able to open the store like you had before uh...

nicole: have it open but how do i steal this only gives me the option of buying it i want to steal it...

zolloz89: Frightened.

TwistedTri: if you're gonna steal it just do the buy and then just give yourself the the money back that's...

nicole: okay i...

zolloz89: Frightened.

zolloz89: A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of fear is within line of sight. You cannot move willingly closer to the source of its fear.

TwistedTri: what yes but...

zolloz89: Yeah, that sucks. I hate that.

TwistedTri: you're not frightened so you're okay...

zolloz89: I know. That doesn't mean I can still not like it. Do we kill the baby? Do we kill the mummy?

TwistedTri: now ball it's still your turn all...

nicole: know sorry i'm i keep getting air i'm trying to like give myself the money back so i can steal something else uh inventory coins that was one i was gonna steal some more russians i just stole the cal traps...

TwistedTri: right well what do you want to steal and i can just drop it in your chart how many rations do you want to steal well...

nicole: i think i'm full on rations i have three of three so i guess i can't oh well then yeah i'll take uh two more it's only he had another torch in his in his store all right well i'm good i stole what i wanted i...

TwistedTri: it'll take another slot if you take more it'll add another slot all...

zolloz89: You can. Yeah.

TwistedTri: right so you should have another batch of rations in your inventory slot now all...

nicole: still only see three of oh no no i see okay yeah we're good...

TwistedTri: right so we're going to enter the master's turn girl...

Eric: I'm not in the room. I am going to... I...

Eric: think that's 60 feet.

zolloz89: Hey, girl.

Eric: Right there.

zolloz89: You made it.

Eric: Howdy.

zolloz89: Do we have... Should we attack the baby?

nicole: i mean i'm scared of it so yes...

zolloz89: Should we just do it?

TwistedTri: does does it make you want it does it make you want to punch a baby like...

Eric: Yeah.

Eric: Let's kill the baby.

Eric: I wonder if these guys...

TwistedTri: rocky grok you're up man...

Eric: I wonder if the tomb is...

zolloz89: Yeah, man.

Eric: The baby.

zolloz89: All right. Fine.

Eric: I'm gonna find it. Oh,

zolloz89: Fine. Bring an axe two-handed. Like, straight down on... On our mummy.

TwistedTri: okay, oh no, that is a success,

zolloz89: I successfully hit the mummy.

TwistedTri: that is, that is going to be enough to kill the baby,

Eric: Jesus.

TwistedTri: but but you hear screaming from the two guards in the other room,

nicole: oh my god...

zolloz89: Yeah,

zolloz89: I sure do.

Eric: Oh my God.

zolloz89: I know. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah.

TwistedTri: and they are going to join.

TwistedTri: they are going to join the initiative all...

zolloz89: Yeah. I...

zolloz89: peek around the corner. I point at Durrell. I said, this is your fault. I'm gonna...

nicole: this is...

Eric: I didn't kill the baby.

zolloz89: I'm gonna back up a little bit.

Eric: I was trying to bring the baby to its mother.

nicole: what happens when you fuck around with babies y'all i told you...

TwistedTri: right rock. uh, your turn is: what do you want to do here? are you are? you're stealing stuff.

zolloz89: I'm taking some... I'm taking some stuff on my turn. Oh, yeah. All right.

TwistedTri: so all right ball. it's your turn again. you hear that. you hear that unearthly scream or bellowing coming from the the two ante chambers to the to the west...

nicole: yeah...

nicole: um.

nicole: okay, so they're. sorry, so they're out here. okay, sorry, out here,

TwistedTri: they're down down here here and up here and...

zolloz89: Yeah, they're gonna be coming this way.

nicole: okay.

nicole: well, i got what i want out of here. um, wasn't there. another door back here where the baby was, yeah...

Eric: Yeah, there was a door to the... In the baby room. The initial baby room.

nicole: yeah, okay, so i went in there. i went 25, that's 30 feet. i'm gonna unlock the door. oh, there's stairs. so i'm gonna walk into the area with the stairs and make that my turn. yeah, oh,

TwistedTri: unfortunately those doors do not go anywhere at this time there's a there's there's a collapse at the end of the stairs and you can't get through them...

nicole: seriously, balls all right. well then i'm gonna go.

nicole: i'm gonna go back 15 feet, and then that's the end of my time. everybody sucks, girl...

Eric: Now Daryl's gonna die.

TwistedTri: the the first.

TwistedTri: the first guard is going to is going to slowly turn.

zolloz89: Durrell might... Might deserve it.

Eric: Yeah, Daryl sort of had a couple...

TwistedTri: all you hear is, i guard the tomb,

nicole: absolutely does deserve it oh...

Eric: I...

TwistedTri: you disturbed the tomb and it's going to walk up and target durl and is going to try, uh, to do a scimitar. and this is really really bad because, um, it has a special feature called unending watch, which gains a plus two attack if standing within or near of a tomb entrance.

Eric: didn't...

TwistedTri: so it's going to get the normal roll here. so let's see if we get a hit.

nicole: lord...

TwistedTri: uh oh, that's going to be a hit. four is one...

Eric: Oh boy.

TwistedTri: button there we go oh my goodness all...

TwistedTri: right so we're going to get uh damage is going to be one d6 plus two uh...

Eric: I'm already dead.

TwistedTri: that's going to be five points of damage to uh sir dural there all...

Eric: The Daryl's dead.

Eric: Daryl is gone. Because he had... Two HP left.

TwistedTri: right so you're going to go to you're going to go to um zero hit points and you'll go unconscious and let's see dying is not automated in this game like it is in pathfinder so let me look up real quick what the dying rules are because there is a way to stabilize you but uh it's going to be a bit of a challenge since you got two of these guys here um both kind of flanking you um we'll go ahead and go to the other tombs guy he's going to take a step into the room and stop there...

nicole: oh no...

Eric: Is there any chance that they'll... Sort of ignore the other people?

Eric: Like can... Like is there a way that...

nicole: i'm...

TwistedTri: dural, dural, dural.

Eric: Rock and Ball can get away?

TwistedTri: listen,

TwistedTri: you're gonna die in three rounds if no one can come stabilize you i'm...

Eric: Yeah.

Eric: I wouldn't stabilize me if I was them. I would get the hell out of me.

TwistedTri: gonna say that there's that you have a chance to save that yourself though yeah...

zolloz89: That sounds right.

Eric: You mean there's a role I could do?

Eric: Which I could do? And then...

zolloz89: Yeah,

zolloz89: there's a death save.

Eric: There's a role I could do?

Eric: And then these guys... Attacking me?

nicole: gonna.

nicole: i'm gonna take a bio break real quick while you guys are picking that up.

TwistedTri: i paused it so we don't don't burn the torch as well i double check this one no i appreciate you i...

Eric: I...

nicole: appreciate you can...

Eric: appreciate it.

TwistedTri: need to bring up the the pdf is going to be easier to search...

zolloz89: Yeah. I feel like Shadow Dark is real bad about having stuff just, like, pop up on Google.

TwistedTri: this is one of those i should have been more familiar with before we got into this one but...

Eric: Well... You had no reason to know... That I was gonna pick up the baby... And run with it.

zolloz89: And then you compound the fact that I'm playing the idiot.

zolloz89: Death timer. Stabilize.

zolloz89: On turn. Roll a d20. On a 20. Rise of the one hit point. Page...

zolloz89: four.

zolloz89: That's what I'm reading.

Eric: What can I do? Roll a D20?

zolloz89: Like, the... Kind of the summary in the very front of the book. It's, like, page three or four.

TwistedTri: yeah death timer roll a d4 plus your constitution on turn roll a d20 20 rise with one hit point stabilize close range dc 15 intelligence check on a success target stops dying but still unconscious so that's if they can save you uh so you have three rounds to roll a 20 essentially you...

Eric: So... So what do... Alright. So rolling here... It looks like the rolling has changed. Like what do I change? The number to one? Look to D20.

TwistedTri: just. you're just going to roll a d20 period. yes,

Eric: Roll one. Alright.

nicole: y'all hear me oh okay good...

zolloz89: Yeah, we can.

TwistedTri: so that is not going to do it. uh, that is your turn this round,

Eric: That's a four.

Eric: So that doesn't do it.

zolloz89: It's not a 20.

Eric: My turn? Alright. I'll be right back.

TwistedTri: or will you eric?

Eric: Well... I'll be back.

Eric: Daryl.

TwistedTri: eric will be back, but maybe not dural.

Eric: Daryl and the other... Probably not long for this world.

TwistedTri: grok. you get your first look of dural. uh, unconscious on the ground. uh, and you see that one of the guards is to the north and you maybe just see that there's a sliver of a guard to the south.

zolloz89: I feel like I can assume that both guards are moving in on Durrell.

TwistedTri: yes, i...

zolloz89: Whether or not I can see him.

zolloz89: I feel like I want to just hit him.

nicole: that girl he really did so...

zolloz89: I mean, he did it to himself. He got hit. It's,

zolloz89: like, I was gonna punch you, but you got punched, so.

TwistedTri: just want to say for the record this is not how i saw this playing out at all oh...

nicole: when we're done with the night i want you to tell us how you actually saw it working out please...

zolloz89: Good.

zolloz89: Yeah, for sure.

zolloz89: Let's see.

TwistedTri: sure yeah oh...

zolloz89: Okay.

zolloz89: I'm gonna continue my movement. I'm gonna attempt to grappling hook with my razor chain onto Durrell and pull him in to the room with us.

TwistedTri: nice okay uh so let's do let's do a strength check on that yeah so just do a dc12 strength check...

zolloz89: I will give you the strength trick.

zolloz89: Fuck it up.

zolloz89: So close.

TwistedTri: so close, but you, uh, you either fall just short or you can't. you can't hook on to them,

zolloz89: I'm gonna... I gotta lock it.

TwistedTri: okay...

zolloz89: I'll roll again.

zolloz89: You only get one of my luck points. And it's even worse. Sorry. Sorry, Durrell.

TwistedTri: no no no it...

nicole: girl had to die do do do do do goodbye girl okay...

TwistedTri: is your turn you are you don't know what's happened down there uh well up in the the main corridor okay...

nicole: so i walk up here walk back to the door that's 10 feet well...

zolloz89: Durrell's down. We gotta get past at least one of the guards that are apparently awake now.

nicole: that's inconvenient um all right grack which way now which which way uh which way is dural oh i see him okay all right well i guess i gotta save that idiot uh so i'm gonna hold on matt can you help me make sure i understand my charge ability so i can charge into combat combat by moving at least near before attacking and my melee attack still double damage close...

zolloz89: Yeah. I don't necessarily want him to die, but...

TwistedTri: so near is adjacent to i'm sorry yeah i'm sorry i'm sorry yep yep uh yep you're right so...

zolloz89: No, near is 30. Close is...

nicole: is: yeah, okay,

zolloz89: I think it's saying you have to move at least 30 feet and then do the attack.

nicole: so i'm oh,

nicole: i have to move. i have to move at least 30 feet,

nicole: or i just have to be within 30 feet of them.

zolloz89: Because you're, like,

zolloz89: running at him, right?

nicole: yeah, well,

nicole: i was over here next to you,

zolloz89: Yeah.

zolloz89: Maybe...

nicole: i...

TwistedTri: there is a rule to move through enemies as well if you just want to try and move through them...

zolloz89: Yeah, I guess I don't have the attacks to the desert, I think.

nicole: was just trying to use my charge thing because it deals double damage but if i can't do it because i'm too close then that's that...

TwistedTri: well you moved your well where did you move from down there because you already went that's 40 feet so you can't do both of those in one one turn your next turn you could do it...

Eric: I would leave... I would leave Daryl to die.

nicole: okay okay well then i'm gonna move got...

zolloz89: Because it's, like, you're...

zolloz89: I think the intent is that you're, like,

zolloz89: running straight at him for 30 feet and then you do double damage on your attack.

TwistedTri: yeah well...

nicole: it okay well i'm gonna just hide around the corner then until my next turn mm...

zolloz89: Cool.

Eric: I would leave Daryl...

TwistedTri: actually,

TwistedTri: if you want it, wait. wait,

Eric: I would leave Daryl to die.

TwistedTri: if you want to set your hold on a minute, if you want to set yourself up for that attack, next you should end.

nicole: -hmm...

TwistedTri: you should end yourself here, because that gives you a 30 foot straight shot into him to charge at in the next. your next turn,

nicole: okay thank you as earl had to die do do do do do do do do do...

TwistedTri: you're welcome...

TwistedTri: girl give me a d20 oh that was so close uh all right that is dural's turn one round all...

zolloz89: How do you roll a four twice?

nicole: there's two rounds left right oh one round left oh lord goodbye girl okay...

TwistedTri: right, grok, you got to try that again. oh no, you're. i'm sorry, you are two rounds. that first one didn't count as round number one. so you were right, nikki, i don't think we,

nicole: yeah i was like if it's only one round when he's dead like that's just sorry you...

TwistedTri: i don't think we, i think. uh, jason stepped away for a second,

TwistedTri: so we'll wait till he comes back,

zolloz89: Oh,

zolloz89: no, I'm here.

TwistedTri: oh you...

zolloz89: I don't know what to do.

zolloz89: I mean, yeah, try it again.

zolloz89: I don't want to get... I don't...

TwistedTri: can.

TwistedTri: you can spend luck to roll with advantage. you know,

TwistedTri: if you really want to. if you want to do that,

zolloz89: Yeah,

zolloz89: but I don't want to use my last luck on Durrell.

Eric: But have I used a lock to retry to rebuild a 20 or is that...

TwistedTri: yeah,

TwistedTri: do you want? you want to use that luck to save the person that got you into this mess i'm...

Eric: No.

zolloz89: Oh, you're making a real convincing argument.

TwistedTri: just what would grok do in this moment yeah...

Eric: You guys could have just let me die.

zolloz89: You know, he knows there's... You know there's two of them. And that's the problem. He doesn't...

Eric: Can you guys hear me okay?

zolloz89: He doesn't know that two of them are there? Yeah.

TwistedTri: we we can hear you eric...

Eric: Just let me die because you guys are probably gonna get killed by these things.

zolloz89: You say that.

nicole: didn't seem very like sportsman like...

zolloz89: Yeah.

TwistedTri: well the rule on so there's the rule on getting through them if you would like to you have the option to uh pass a simple strength or dexterity check uh to move like to roll through or run around an enemy and go through their square nope...

zolloz89: I'm gonna get back to town and... Yeah.

zolloz89: Yeah, I'll try it again. I'll try and lasso him with my whip chain.

zolloz89: Maybe I can roll a fucking strength check. Nope.

TwistedTri: i love this for you, because this is like one of your highest stats. if you can't,

zolloz89: I know.

TwistedTri: you're like under pressure and you can't get it working there we go all right, so you end up pulling him right over to you all...

zolloz89: Uh-huh. The whole thing. I'll use my last luck point. And I'm gonna roll a goddamn 19 plus four.

zolloz89: And then that was my action. So I can't... I gotta move the other side of him, I guess.

zolloz89: And... Be ready. All right.

TwistedTri: right. so then stabilize.

TwistedTri: you can do a 15 intelligence check ball if you want to get right up next to him. uh, and do a dc 15 intelligence check to see if you can. uh, oh, you're good, you're, you're, you're diagonal from him. so if you want to do that, go for it i...

zolloz89: It's a 15 intelligence check.

zolloz89: Oh.

nicole: so do that before i do my charge...

TwistedTri: would at least take a shot here and see, if you can, if you can stabilize him. yeah,

nicole: intelligence i'm pretty smart you're...

TwistedTri: yes,

TwistedTri: oh,

zolloz89: Yeah, it's not for... It's not for good old Grok.

TwistedTri: my goodness, okay,

zolloz89: That was scary.

TwistedTri: so you are no longer dying. uh,

zolloz89: He is unconscious.

nicole: welcome...

TwistedTri: but you are unconscious,

TwistedTri: so let's give you the unconscious it...

Eric: Thank you. Thank you.

Eric: Now what do I do here? I have to...

Eric: Do I give myself an H... Do I get any hit points?

zolloz89: Well, you're just unconscious now.

zolloz89: No. I don't think so.

TwistedTri: stops dying, but you are still unconscious. so, um, i think what will happen is, while it doesn't say it, i think, to get that to trigger, to stop you, give yourself the one hit point.

TwistedTri: so give yourself,

zolloz89: Yeah, that makes sense.

Eric: Do I give myself one?

TwistedTri: give yourself one hit point, but you remain unconscious,

TwistedTri: all right. so ball, you managed to, uh, you managed to stabilize him, and now you want to try your charge thing, uh...

zolloz89: Slap the shit out of him.

nicole: sure i do oh...

nicole: i just clicked the roll but i didn't do anything how...

TwistedTri: no you just put the message in there so uh you could charge into combat at least each time you do this your melee attack deals double damage for that round okay so that's assuming that you make the hit so go ahead uh so go ahead and target and do your attack well...

nicole: do i do this attack like so,

zolloz89: Yeah, move up on him.

nicole: but i mean i just like i just moved my token, okay,

zolloz89: Yeah.

TwistedTri: so what's that what's gonna mechanically what's gonna happen is yeah you're gonna run up you're gonna do whatever you're gonna do and you're either gonna pass or fail the attack if you've if you pass the attack then you'll get double damage that's...

nicole: i...

nicole: don't want to use my bolas i'll just...

TwistedTri: a ranged weapon both of your weapons are oh no your your whip can be melee or ranged...

nicole: okay, well then, i'm using my whip.

nicole: i got one.

zolloz89: We got whips.

TwistedTri: whips and chains uh...

nicole: where is? oh, that's party, no wonder i'm like everything's gone from my sheet. i was looking at the party sheet. where is my freaking? okay, now i can't get my sheet to come up. there we go my whip. okay, watch me whip.

nicole: watch me nae nae balls. um,

TwistedTri: that is going to be a fail and...

nicole: you know what i'm gonna, or i could,

TwistedTri: you're gonna end your and you're gonna end your turn uh oh you still have five feet of movement you...

nicole: um,

nicole: i would say, or i could re-roll, with luck, i'm...

TwistedTri: could re-roll with luck...

zolloz89: Here.

nicole: gonna do that? okay. so, minus, get rid of my luck now. and then talent, where do i put the re-roll with, is it? oh,

TwistedTri: you just roll,

zolloz89: Let's roll it again.

nicole: this is not to.

TwistedTri: just just roll your uh,

nicole: it's a normal roll. yeah, okay...

TwistedTri: just roll the uh.

zolloz89: Yeah. That's good.

TwistedTri: that is a success. uh,

zolloz89: Better than a four.

nicole: mm-hmm way better i...

Eric: Uh-oh.

TwistedTri: and you rolled.

TwistedTri: you rolled three, so it's gonna take six points of damage, you're...

zolloz89: And then your torch expired. Right after that.

nicole: sure did i have no clue what's happening around me and i don't have another torch so...

Eric: I...

Eric: don't have any more torches either. But I do have... I can cast Light.

TwistedTri: unconscious all...

Eric: But I'm unconscious.

nicole: grok you got a torch there buddy...

zolloz89: Yeah. I mean, I gotta wait. Till it's my turn.

TwistedTri: right so ball that's the end of your turn and the other tomb guard is going to step up it saw that you tried to charge its partner over there and it's going to target you and try to hit you with its scimitar and...

nicole: sorry damn...

TwistedTri: that is going to be a success for seven seven points of damage...

nicole: it i'm...

nicole: not gonna be long for this world either you...

zolloz89: Don't like to hear that.

TwistedTri: whoops, that did, that didn't? that didn't work. edit that, yeah,

nicole: took all my hit points math...

TwistedTri: i was not supposed to. you had nine. it took. you should have two left. uh,

nicole: is an important thing...

TwistedTri: apparently that plugin does not work. so i'm gonna turn that off and that'll be his turn. oh gosh ball. it's rough luck being surrounded by the the, the tomb guards, and having them fall that way in the initiative all...

nicole: i can't see anything so it doesn't matter death can find me i'll never know...

TwistedTri: right, that's going to be, uh, an additional five points of damage. so that's going to take you down to zero hit points. uh, and you are going to be dead and the next turn, next time you roll, it will roll your death timer counter.

TwistedTri: actually,

zolloz89: Oh.

TwistedTri: uh, before we do that, uh, it is going to step back into the other room. uh, as it seems, as it appears, to have taken, uh, two of your party members out, it doesn't feel it needs both of you. uh, both of them, uh, for the threat there. so it is going to move out of the room. all right, dural, you are still unconscious, so there is nothing you can do here. grok, you just saw. actually, you didn't even see,

zolloz89: I didn't see shit. I just turned my torch on.

TwistedTri: okay, so you turn your torch on. you see ball unconscious,

TwistedTri: dying on the ground,

zolloz89: God.

zolloz89: Damn it.

TwistedTri: and you see, and you now know that. uh. uh, dural has been at least stabilized. so how do you want to? what do you want to do here..?

zolloz89: How would I be able to... Get Durl up?

TwistedTri: you can shake him awake i'll i'll just that's fine you can take an action to rouse him all...

zolloz89: I'm gonna do that while applying a healing herb to him.

TwistedTri: right. so he's going to be unconscious. oops, and you are going to apply a healing herb.

TwistedTri: he's only going to get one one hit point back.

zolloz89: That's fine.

zolloz89: He's got like three hit points anyway, so like, whatever.

Eric: I get two out of three, right?

TwistedTri: so go ahead and give yourself another hit point. you got two out of three and you are now standing what...

zolloz89: What can I do to prepare something?

TwistedTri: do you want to try and pull ball back...

zolloz89: Why not?

zolloz89: I'm not... I'm not... I'm not...

nicole: thanks bud thanks...

zolloz89: Nah, with a 15? I got it.

TwistedTri: and you got it so all right ball is going to come back as well all...

zolloz89: Cool.

nicole: yo oh...

zolloz89: We're gonna enter some tug-of-war contests when we get back.

TwistedTri: right so ball you're going to die in two rounds unless you get stabilized uh...

nicole: all right okay...

zolloz89: You could...

zolloz89: You had to roll the d20, though.

TwistedTri: yep you get to roll a d20 here...

nicole: why is it not...

Eric: Will Cure Wounds stabilize,

TwistedTri: so underneath the chat,

TwistedTri: you can just click the d20 button and run. run it that way,

Eric: Matt?

nicole: that's what oh there it is...

TwistedTri: all right, not this time, but that's okay. still got, still got time they...

TwistedTri: know that you have to leave that chamber and that they you only have two ways out so they are going to continue to guard at their post and lie in wait you...

zolloz89: Durl, you got fucking intelligence, right?

Eric: Alright. So I can...

TwistedTri: have to be next. you have to be adjacent to uh, to ball yep,

Eric: Okay.

TwistedTri: uh,

Eric: There's that. And I can do Cure Wounds, right?

TwistedTri: yeah, yeah,

Eric: That will... That will help her, right? Or... That will help... Paul.

TwistedTri: i think so...

zolloz89: Yeah.

Eric: Um... Alright. Try it.

Eric: You gotta be kidding me. I'm gonna use a lock there.

nicole: oh thank you...

Eric: Not that it's helped me before. But... I've just... Had bad spins. Alright. Let's try it again.

TwistedTri: there we go all right so nikki go ahead and roll a d6...

nicole: a d6 no...

Eric: Now how does this work, Matt? Because I'm successful... On that.

TwistedTri: oh nice all right so it says on there your touch restores ebbing life roll the number of d6 is equal to one plus half your level rounded down so one plus one half is still only one so she gets one d6 of healing she rolled a six so she'll get six hit points and will be able to will not be unconscious anymore go...

nicole: huzzah do i need to go give myself those hit points...

zolloz89: Got it in one. Nailed it.

TwistedTri: ahead and give yourself six hit points yep...

Eric: Now is there anything left in this shop?

nicole: he's back baby...

Eric: Is there anything left in this shop? Um... That's my turn though, right?

zolloz89: You can move. You can still move a little bit more.

Eric: I'm wondering if I should go back to the shop. If I can get over there. And see if I can get... But I can't do anything else. Now I'm next to the shop.

TwistedTri: well, you're there,

Eric: And I can have my turn.

TwistedTri: so if you want to do your shopping while the rest of the, the rest of the group, takes their turn, go ahead.

TwistedTri: just remember it's going to make you buy it. so go ahead and buy it and then put the put the money back in your account...

Eric: Oh, but there's no...

Eric: I don't think there's anything left here to help me heal.

zolloz89: Heel, no. So, um...

nicole: that was bad all...

TwistedTri: rations would be the only thing i mean really all...

Eric: That's okay. Now...

zolloz89: Is... Durl,

zolloz89: is there any... Is there any rope in there?

Eric: there is no rope. But hold on. I may have...

zolloz89: All right. You owe me some rope.

zolloz89: And he's gonna tie this door shut.

Eric: Yeah.

zolloz89: Effectively trying to lock it. So, homie can't come this way.

TwistedTri: right so you get that door locked all...

zolloz89: All right.

Eric: I have like a grappling hook.

Eric: And I have rope. Here.

zolloz89: Yep.

zolloz89: Well, you owe me a rope. I have rope. You owe me a new one. Is what I mean.

Eric: I'll give you one.

zolloz89: And I'm gonna post up right on the door. I'm gonna pull out my great axe.

TwistedTri: right ball...

nicole: right well i'm alive again and that's cool um like like i guess first off guys like we're going out there like guns a-blazing right we're gonna like get past these guards do...

Eric: Hold.

zolloz89: Just the one. Yep.

Eric: Yeah. Grok.

zolloz89: Hopefully just the one, anyway.

Eric: Yeah. Grok. Tied.

nicole: we know which way. the one, the one that ran you up, uh, hold on this. nope, one thing this way, yeah,

Eric: Which one did you tie?

nicole: so...

Eric: Which one did you tie off, Grok?

zolloz89: This one.

Eric: The one of the north is tied off.

nicole: he can't come help his buddy. now,

nicole: all right, well then, i'm gonna. i'm gonna move, come on there, and that's the other one.

zolloz89: That's the... That's the idea.

Eric: In theory.

zolloz89: Mm-hmm.

nicole: okay, well, i can't i'm...

nicole: gonna use my bolas and throw it at them um how do i my bola is not showing up as a pack how do i make it show up as an attack well...

TwistedTri: you have to uh toggle it equipped put that button next to it...

TwistedTri: you turned them off now so...

nicole: they were they were up there i had it so equipped and equip...

TwistedTri: i'm guessing you actually can't use the bolus well...

nicole: why not name...

Eric: And I put the baby in my inventory.

nicole: okay well then i'm gonna use my whip um not my uh my good friend there i'm gonna just step right over you and then i'm gonna okay...

zolloz89: Where to God?

Eric: I'm not kidding.

TwistedTri: let's, let's, let's,

TwistedTri: let's role play, the bolus part, because i actually think that it's just not in the shadow dark part right now, because that's from one of the newer scrolls. so let's, let's figure out what that does. so, this is a throwing weapon that will, that will tangle around the feet of an enemy, so you're gonna throw it. uh, usually it's around the feet, so they get they, so they get tripped up. uh, this is,

nicole: okay mm-hmm or the face of an enemy or the face or the face um okay i...

TwistedTri: this is not a damage weapon, this is a. this is a. they can't move type weapon.

TwistedTri: so if so..,

zolloz89: It...

zolloz89: It reduces speed to close.

nicole: also okay well whatever okay...

zolloz89: I can only move one space. So you kind of want to do it from further back.

TwistedTri: it will slow it down if you if you are successful on this uh...

nicole: how do i mean what do i roll for it since i can't roll the attack...

zolloz89: Dex for throwing? Or strength?

TwistedTri: you're gonna roll a d20 plus your.

TwistedTri: let's do a dexter strength, whichever one's better for you.

TwistedTri: so then just go ahead and roll a. uh, your, your dc is going to be 14 here. so pick one and it's dc: 14 decks or strength, since they're correct, since you don't actually have a button for it up there, we're improvising...

nicole: they're the same...

nicole: what do you mean pick one what are you telling me to roll that for my character sheet okay okay and then okay so just normal roll i got it oh come on okay...

TwistedTri: yeah, if you'd, rather i can put it in chat for you if you want it. that way too, okay, all right. so that is a.

TwistedTri: there's a fail. your bolus goes,

Eric: Okay.

TwistedTri: uh, zipping past and hits the back wall behind it all...

nicole: well, i'm gonna. oh,

nicole: that's so i'm gonna yep someone. oh, come on here and then...

TwistedTri: right and you've you've moved 15 feet so you have another 15 feet of movement if you wanted to all...

nicole: what did i just do no what did i what is going on okay...

TwistedTri: right that is your that's oh you're closing that door too okay all...

nicole: yep...

TwistedTri: right daryl you're up...

Eric: So now...

Eric: I am going to... Everyone's in that middle room, right?

TwistedTri: yes...

nicole: um yeah, well yeah, we're in the yeah, in between the,

nicole: the sand beetle pit and the baby,

Eric: The two things. So is...

Eric: So...

nicole: uh...

Eric: Are any of the... Are any of the doors open?

zolloz89: This one's open.

Eric: At this point? That one's down there is open. And we have to try to attack this thing, right? The tomb guard.

zolloz89: Or run. Or run.

zolloz89: You can...

Eric: But we can't... Oh,

Eric: you mean run by him the other direction?

zolloz89: You can...

Eric: All...

zolloz89: You can strength or dex pass them.

Eric: right. So how far did I move here? It doesn't say.

TwistedTri: you've moved 60 feet.

TwistedTri: i don't know how you did that, because you, you must have moved up and down and over and back and forth to get 60 feet.

Eric: So that's it for me.

Eric: Can you... Can we reset me back to where I was?

TwistedTri: yeah, so you were there. so that's,

Eric: This is where I started, right?

TwistedTri: that's restarted, yep...

Eric: All right. So... All...

TwistedTri: that's 30 feet right here uh this this this was 30 right here...

Eric: right. And then... What is it? Each thing... Each block's five, right?

Eric: So that's... Five, ten, fifteen, twenty...

Eric: I don't want to be right next to this guy.

TwistedTri: uh,

TwistedTri: you can't stop there because that's the same token, same square that grax.

Eric: I'm going to just stop right here. So I'm even...

Eric: All right.

TwistedTri: in there you go. okay,

Eric: I'll stay right here.

Eric: Because if these guys hit me, I'm dead immediately.

TwistedTri: grok, what do you want to do it..?

zolloz89: Uh... I think I'm just gonna walk by him.

zolloz89: Oh, wait.

Eric: Oh, shit.

zolloz89: Neither of them had a torch, right? I'm...

TwistedTri: is correct all...

nicole: -huh...

zolloz89: I'm gonna go back.

zolloz89: I'm gonna go back. I'm gonna somehow give Durrell my remaining torch. And say, you also owe me a torch. And then I will move my spaces. Let's...

TwistedTri: right so take a torch out of your inventory dural put one in your inventory please uh...

nicole: i'm...

Eric: All right. How do I add... The torch?

TwistedTri: you can do shift space type in torch and drag it onto your character sheet...

Eric: And I'm...

Eric: Shift space.

TwistedTri: type in torch it'll...

Eric: Yep.

Eric: Oh, here we go.

Eric: Add a torch. And then I can...

Eric: Am I allowed to turn the torch on? Or is that... That's going to be a move on my next turn?

zolloz89: see what I'm trying.

TwistedTri: be on your turn you got to turn that on uh somehow you've got one that's already lit though...

Eric: I died and I had one.

Eric: And it... It doesn't show up anymore in my inventory.

TwistedTri: no, but you had to have dropped one on the on the map somewhere, because the map is lit up right there. now i don't see it, though. well,

TwistedTri: it is what it is: all right ball. where are we going? that's 25 feet right there...

Eric: Well, it would... Yeah.

nicole: gonna see if i can yeah i'm gonna see if i can walk right by him 30 35 40 45 50 55 60.

TwistedTri: he's seeing you guys lee and is gonna take two steps forward and try and take out the leader of your band here oh...

Eric: So...

zolloz89: Got it.

TwistedTri: and that's not gonna cut it uh and he sees your great axe and doesn't want to be a part of that and it's gonna take two steps back they're...

nicole: what i thought...

Eric: So now... If I go... If I use my stealthy talent... Which is once per day you become invisible for three rounds... Can I still move? Okay.

TwistedTri: all you...

TwistedTri: yes as long as you don't do anything hostile you won't be seen i...

Eric: So I am going to... Use that. I don't know how to use it. I think it's just I tell you, right? That I'm using it.

Eric: All right. So now...

zolloz89: Pretty much.

TwistedTri: made you invisible that's...

zolloz89: We just... See a torch.

nicole: just a floating torch i...

zolloz89: The fuck? Ball, you see in this shit? I thought I... I didn't think I drank that much today.

TwistedTri: true that is true yeah...

Eric: Guys, it's me. I'm invisible. I just didn't think I could make it by.

nicole: think i'm hearing things sounds like uh uh our buddy derl no you don't huh...

Eric: I might want to go back and grab that baby again, though. I'm going to go back and grab...

zolloz89: I think that rock hit me in the head.

zolloz89: I think that rock hit me in the head harder than I thought.

Eric: All right.

Eric: I need to get... Find the combat tracker here.

Eric: As I... Enter. There we go.

TwistedTri: like somehow you made yourself uh a light source all...

zolloz89: The light source.

Eric: I don't know how I would have done that. I didn't... I don't think I casted.

Eric: I inadvertently cast light.

TwistedTri: right let me let me fix that...

zolloz89: Did he...

zolloz89: Did you... Did you drag the torch onto your character or onto your sheet?

Eric: I dragged it into my inventory.

Eric: And it's not lit. I don't know what the heck happened.

TwistedTri: there we go fixed,

TwistedTri: but you want the torch lit right or you don't? well,

Eric: Fix the glitch.

Eric: I do want to... Um... Does it really matter at this point?

Eric: All right. Let me put that on. I'll put the torch on.

TwistedTri: at this point, you and ball are both in the dark all...

nicole: huh so it kind of matters all...

Eric: So it does matter.

TwistedTri: right so ball you're up...

nicole: right well i'm gonna follow my friend wait do i have a torch on why i see i have light though...

TwistedTri: you do not you have light because dural and grok both have light all...

Eric: I'll be really careful here because this... This room that we're about to go in, there were drag marks here.

nicole: stuff oh...

Eric: I don't know if we'll trigger anything inadvertently.

nicole: that's the room with drag marks...

zolloz89: The very beginning, yeah.

Eric: Like the one all the way to the left is where we sort of started. That room where we had to pick three. Yeah,

TwistedTri: right dural okay...

zolloz89: I mean, the door is open, at least.

Eric: I had opened that door earlier.

Eric: I can't stop there, can't I? It's a ball, so...

zolloz89: And if I...

zolloz89: get... I'll pick up the scorpion.

TwistedTri: well...

zolloz89: I'll just add to this treasure with no value.

zolloz89: And then I'll go to the door.

nicole: yeah, you said you're stopping at the door.

nicole: did we want to go back and try and go up those other stairs like: go go all the way north,

zolloz89: Yeah, that was my movement. Are...

zolloz89: we ready to go up the stairs?

zolloz89: We don't have any, like, torches to do that.

nicole: that's okay, yeah,

zolloz89: We have a...

nicole: you're a good point, okay..?

zolloz89: We have a torch.

Eric: And I'm... And I have light.

TwistedTri: you've got an hour left on girls torch and 12 minutes left on grok's,

TwistedTri: and there you go. yeah, so dural's got an additional hour of light. uh, if you can all...

Eric: I have light if I can cast it. Which is suspect at best.

zolloz89: I'm gonna operate as if Durrell doesn't have any extra light.

nicole: yeah okay well that that's as far as i can see so i'm just gonna stop there...

Eric: Yeah. Because Jural's been rolling twos and fours. All...

zolloz89: That's where we came in. Where there wasn't really anything until the entrance.

TwistedTri: right.

TwistedTri: so you guys are opting to leave.

Eric: right. I have to stop there.

TwistedTri: leave the area all right.

zolloz89: Yes.

nicole: apparently yeah...

TwistedTri: so go ahead and go ahead. and well, let me, let me go ahead and extinguish your torches.

TwistedTri: um, it now appears that this area is semi-safe, as you've been through here. do you want to camp and rest here,

TwistedTri: or would you like to find someplace else in the in the desert to camp for the night and get your rest and everything..?

Eric: Yeah,

zolloz89: Probably better to camp in here, huh?

Eric: I think so.

nicole: probably...

TwistedTri: so, go ahead and consume your rations. uh, restore your hit points, do all the stuff that you need to do. and uh, it's 11 o'clock, so there's a perfect stopping point here. um so, my original thought here was: the stairs were a ruse, like they didn't lead anywhere. they were both gonna be, uh,

Eric: Dead ends.

TwistedTri: crumbled doorways so that you couldn't get that. this was this, was it?

TwistedTri: this is? uh, this is just a a five room dungeon. uh, for you to kind of explore. get your feet wet for shadow, dark mechanics, which you certainly got your feet wet, uh, and got your hands dirty on a few things. the baby, i thought for sure, like when you heard the wailing baby, like you were just gonna close that door and just back away, and like just not have anything to do with it,

nicole: rude...

zolloz89: Well,

TwistedTri: and...

Eric: I just... I just...

zolloz89: we did.

nicole: that's what i wanted to do technically...

zolloz89: We did...

Eric: I just... I just said,

zolloz89: To be fair,

Eric: you know...

zolloz89: we did do that.

Eric: Yeah, well, two of us did that. And I went in and grabbed the baby.

zolloz89: And then you went against the discussion of the group.

Eric: Yeah, I know.

TwistedTri: so so here's the thing that's so funny. my two chaotic people did not do that.

TwistedTri: my neutral person did that...

zolloz89: Yeah.

Eric: Well, I was thinking... Part of me was thinking... There's that whole ghost that was crying. Could I take the baby to the ghost somehow? And maybe get a key. Because we didn't have the key yet at that point.

zolloz89: The ghost wanted a lost loved one from Larry.

zolloz89: It could have been. That implied the baby might have been... I mean, the baby was dead. And then undead. So, yeah. Okay.

Eric: The lost loved one might have been the baby, though.

Eric: Yeah. What was the ghost, Matt? Could you tell us anything about the ghost?

zolloz89: It was one of the random fucking dice rolls.

TwistedTri: it was a random encounter yep...

Eric: Uh-uh. So it had... I thought...

zolloz89: when he was rolling in the gauntlet we first played and he didn't roll any of them. It was one of those, I thought. I was like, all right, cool.

Eric: I thought... I thought the ghost was something to do with the... Like, it was like a pre-planned...

zolloz89: I mean,

zolloz89: it could have.

TwistedTri: that?

TwistedTri: yeah,

Eric: Yeah.

TwistedTri: it absolutely. you guys absolutely could have interacted with it. um,

TwistedTri: but the the text on that was it. it wasn't gonna attack you, it was distracted and weeping. uh, and that that's it. that's the only, the only flavor text that i got for it, and it was whatever you guys wanted to do with that. so if you had managed to somehow get the baby over there, but the second you attacked the baby, i made a split second decision to have the tomb guards come after you,

Eric: It wasn't gonna...

TwistedTri: because that was not like the grok did,

nicole: he didn't attack the baby. well,

Eric: Well... Rock did.

TwistedTri: but the tomb guard,

nicole: he did after. sorry, he did. after the baby attacked him, but like not initially,

nicole: the baby started it, which again is why i say we don't deal with babies, but you know oh...

Eric: I...

TwistedTri: the tomb guards didn't come after you until rock had attacked and killed the,

Eric: Why would the...

zolloz89: Yeah.

Eric: Why wouldn't have the tomb gods...

TwistedTri: killed the baby again you...

Eric: Why wouldn't have the tomb gods come at me when I... Maybe instead of running with it.

TwistedTri: didn't hurt it...

Eric: Part of me was like... Let's see. Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

zolloz89: I mean, to be fair, I didn't either. It just died.

nicole: my god well...

TwistedTri: okay.

TwistedTri: so,

Eric: In...

TwistedTri: uh, there are two other things in this route, in this dungeon, that you completely missed.

zolloz89: I'm sure there was something down here.

TwistedTri: nope, there was nothing down there. uh,

TwistedTri: the drag marks,

zolloz89: Or,

zolloz89: like, more in it. Yeah.

TwistedTri: the drag marks. if any of you would have gone to investigate the drag marks, you would have seen that this is a trap door and behind it is a secret chamber, and in the secret chamber was some pretty sweet loot, uh. and then up here where those three- uh, what looked like- seemingly end, uh, ending hallways. had you gone down this one, you would have seen a series of stones that were well worn that maybe, if you had pushed them, would open another secret door into another secret chamber with some more really cool loot there...

Eric: terms of what we needed to see in here. Like, to progress. Or was this really just an optional thing? Because we didn't really even...

TwistedTri: you could have absolutely skipped this this was completely optional it was there on the map it showed up you didn't have to go in here if you didn't want to you could have just kept on going for the ruins uh...

Eric: I'm...

Eric: guessing... I'm guessing when Ball mentions what she saw... It might give... Or what Pete... What Ball saw...

nicole: who's pete...

Eric: I'm guessing... They might get more information.

TwistedTri: oh,

TwistedTri: you mean the symbols that she saw on the wall in that center room.

Eric: Yeah.

TwistedTri: maybe i don't know that.

Eric: Yeah.

TwistedTri: the only reason i didn't give her any information on that is because i don't have any to give, so i have to figure out something, uh,

zolloz89: You're like, I don't know.

zolloz89: It had stuff in there.

Eric: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

TwistedTri: to give her.

TwistedTri: so i have some notes to to come up with a an idea for that. um, but this is going to be the last time that i tell you what you missed in a map, because i want it to be open where, like. maybe you decide later you want to come back to an area, uh,

Eric: Yeah, yeah. Is...

TwistedTri: and maybe revisit something because you're like ah, you know, i remember, something funny was in there and i want to come back. but i wanted to give you just how i run things to give you an idea so that you know next time you're like man. maybe we should look. maybe that's important. maybe we should look at that, uh, or we're just flat out, ignore it, so, uh...

Eric: there any... Any way we could have killed the tomb guards?

Eric: Or were they just pretty powerful?

zolloz89: Yeah.

TwistedTri: they were a level two, their ac was 14 and their hit points were 13.

TwistedTri: so i mean grok did difficult but not...

zolloz89: Difficult, but... I can fucking...

zolloz89: My two-handed axe does a d10 plus one.

Eric: Yeah, yeah. The problem I would have had is that I only have three hit points in total. So... Chances are... They would just... One shot me every time.

TwistedTri: yeah i mean the the killer on that is that the unending watch they get a plus two attack if they're standing near the two mentions so i mean that's just uh for you guys at the level you're at that's an insta hit every time almost so...

Eric: What did you... What... What did you consider the tomb... The room the baby was originally in?

zolloz89: This.

Eric: Or the whole...

TwistedTri: i uh so i again originally i had assumed that that big long room where larry was in was like some tomb chamber uh and that it had just been stripped over the years but the fact that you guys took the baby i i pulled an audible and made that be the tomb and uh went from there...

zolloz89: You guys is pretty strong.

nicole: yeah i was gonna say that was that was all derl you...

Eric: Yeah. Yeah. Girl... Girl...

Eric: Girl decided he was grabbing the baby. I don't know why, but...

TwistedTri: so i i hope we learned a few important lessons tonight.

zolloz89: That's fine. There'll do what there'll do.

zolloz89: Don't trust... Don't trust Dural.

Eric: He did.

TwistedTri: i you have to have lights on to unlock a door. yes, that was a good lesson. checking for traps is always just a question away and inspecting things for secret passages is again also just a question away,

Eric: Go grab the baby. Yeah, I did.

nicole: have to have lights on to unlock a door when...

TwistedTri: depending on the the okay i gave you. i gave you so that the rules in the book say that for every trap or every secret, i have to give you some clue. now what you do with that clue is up to you. um,

nicole: you say a question away it's just like we just ask you okay well...

zolloz89: Pretty much.

Eric: So...

zolloz89: No perception check.

zolloz89: It doesn't have to be a good clue, either.

TwistedTri: it doesn't have to be a good clue either, but i told you that the he threw the stone and it hit something metal and that there were drag marks on the floor. nobody went to go. look at what those drag marks looked like,

TwistedTri: to see that they were straight lines that came out from the wall and moved over. uh, you just assumed in your mind that it might have been someone dragging a body or something he...

zolloz89: Yeah.

zolloz89: Yeah. Nikki, do you... When you two played the Delta Green scenario that I ran, it's like that. Like, what are you looking for and how are you looking for it?

nicole: okay okay...

zolloz89: Is how this works here, too. It's like,

zolloz89: if you're looking for secret passageways, how are you looking for them?

Eric: How...

Eric: So if Grok... When Grok earlier opened the door and the... What was it? An arrow went at him?

Eric: Or a... Or a... A flame... Yeah.

zolloz89: Sling.

zolloz89: I didn't look at the door. I just opened the door.

TwistedTri: just went and opened it and walked in.

Eric: Well,

zolloz89: I straight up opened the door.

Eric: that's what I'm saying. Like,

Eric: is there any way that he could have possibly disarmed that?

TwistedTri: yes,

Eric: If he asked?

TwistedTri: he absolutely could have asked me: hey, look, i want to check this door. is it safe to open? and i would have told him there is. there is some tension on the doorknob or some something to give it away, that the the door is not freely. you can't freely open it without something happening. i, i will the rules stay, say that i have to tell you, i have to give you a clue and if you guess it, i have to tell you...

Eric: Or was that going to happen regardless?

zolloz89: Yeah.

Eric: Well, what I'm saying is... Is there any way he could have... He could have opened the door still and not gotten hit?

TwistedTri: yes,

TwistedTri: if he would have known that it,

Eric: Okay.

TwistedTri: if he would have checked if it was trapped, i would have told him yes, and then it would have been up to him to figure out. okay, what do i need to do to open that door? do i step aside and open it and let the trap go off? do we try? and yeah,

zolloz89: Yeah. So...

zolloz89: I pulled the door open with my chain, like I did in the baby room.

TwistedTri: that's...

zolloz89: But I didn't... Like, Grok is not smart, so I'm playing him that way.

zolloz89: You saw that the south door was fine and Ball didn't hear anything up top. So he was like, this one's probably fine, too. And straight up opened it.

nicole: wait...

zolloz89: That's... Ball's not smart. He's not going to be smart.

zolloz89: Even though his player might be.

nicole: no ball is smart grok is not smart...

zolloz89: Hey, see? Now you're catching on. Now you're catching on.

TwistedTri: great i...

zolloz89: Now you're catching on.
